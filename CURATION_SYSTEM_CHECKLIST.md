## üîÑ In Progress / Pending Tasks

### High Priority
- [ ] Create actual API implementations (currently using mock data):
  - [ ] Analytics data endpoint
  - [ ] Document upload/processing endpoints
  - [ ] Settings management endpoints
  - [ ] Curator pending/approved/rejected endpoints
  - [ ] Comment moderation endpoints

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Implement document upload interface (`/admin/documents/upload`)
- [ ] Create email notification system for curation events
- [ ] Add real-time updates using Supabase subscriptions
- [ ] Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- [ ] Add export functionality for analytics data

### Low Priority
- [ ] Create mobile-responsive versions of complex tables
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts for curator actions
- [ ] Implement bulk operations for word reviews
- [ ] Add dark mode optimizations for all new components
- [ ] Create onboarding flow for new curators

## üîç AI Pipeline Integration (Discovered)

From the experiments folder analysis:
- Existing PDF to linguistic data extraction using OpenAI
- Outputs in three formats: CLDF, XIGT, OntoLex-Lemon
- Text-to-speech capability from IPA
- Chunking by markdown headings
- ~50 grammatical features extraction

**Note**: Pipeline exists but not yet integrated into the curation system.

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Immediate**:
   - Test all pages with real user roles
   - Fix any remaining UI issues
   - Implement missing API endpoints

2. **Short-term**:
   - Connect document upload to AI pipeline
   - Add real-time notifications
   - Implement batch operations

3. **Long-term**:
   - Scale testing with multiple languages
   - Performance optimization
   - Advanced analytics features

## üìù Notes

- All UI uses consistent design patterns
- Mock data provided for demonstration
- RLS policies ensure data security
- System designed for cultural sensitivity
- Extensible architecture for future features

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **UI Components**: Radix UI, custom components
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL), Edge Functions
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with custom roles
