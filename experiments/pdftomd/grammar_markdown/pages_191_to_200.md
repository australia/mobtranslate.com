Successive constructions are not all that often used in Kuku Yalanji. Those without coreferential NPs are somewhat more common than the others. Where the same actor (and object) is involved in a number of successive actions, co-ordinated topic chains are by far more frequent than subordinate constructions.

# 4.4. 4 Verb + -nyV constructions

Subordinate clauses containing verb + -nyV forms have various functions. They may indicate 'simultaneous action', 'causal', 'prior event', and 'hypothetical reason'. In all but causal clauses the verb + -nyV form has nominal characteristics in that it allows regular neutral case inflections. (-nyV will be glossed as SUB in all functions.)

### 4.4.4.1 Simultaneous action

If two, or more, actions are performed simultaneously by the same or different actors, a subordinate clause with verb + -nyV may be used.<sup>36</sup> (A more loose expression of simultaneous action may be effected by sentence co-ordination; see §4.3. 1 .) The verb form

<sup>36</sup>See R. Hershberger's (1 979:79-80) discussion of "Participle Clause". This term was presumably chosen by R. Hershberger because of the case-marking possibilities of verb + -nyV forms. Note that her example of a "Participle Clause" as "Subject of a causative verb" has not been confirmed by my informants. Causal subordinate clauses with verb + -nyV are discussed in the following subsection.

## 1 72 Chapter 4

in a simultaneous action subordinate clause is often reduplicated because an action would normally have to be ongoing to allow another action to concur. But there are occasions where a non-reduplicated form may be used to indicate simultaneity at a particular moment, as for instance 'I saw the man at the moment that he killed the snake'.

Where two different actors are involved, the main and subordinate clause may have the following common NPs: O = S' or A', oblique object = S' or A'. A sentence with O = S' or A' has the underlying structure:

[A NP 0 NPI tr Verbh : [A/S-NPI (0 NP) Verb] L'

The co-referential NP, marked by subscript b may be deleted in either clause in surface structure and the clause Σ' verb has the surface form: (reduplicated) stem + -nyV. Main and subordinate clause are separated by slight intonation rise on the main-clause verb followed usually by a short pause. This is important for the placement of a co-referential O = S' NP, which shows no formal distinction in form if it is a noun. (In the written presentation the clause boundary is indicated by a comma as in the previously discussed subordinate constructions. )

According to where the co-referential NP is deleted, the surface form has a somewhat different interpretation. Consider the following sentences where the common NP is deleted in the subordinate clause:

- (457) Ngayu yununy nyaji-ny, mayi yurmbi-I-yurmbi-nya l sg.NOM(A) 2sg.ACC(0) hear-PAST food.ABS(O) chew-l-REDUP-SUB jangku-ji. chewing.noise-COMIT 'I heard you chewing food noisily. '
- (458) Bama-ngka Janzman nyaji-I-nyaji-ny, gold Aborigine-ERG:pt(A) Chinese.ABS(O) see-l-REDUP-PAST gold.ABS(O)

baka-I-baka-nya. dig-*l*-REDUP-SUB 'The Aborigine watched the Chinese digging for gold. '

- (459) Wara-ngka warru nyarrma-ny, ngawuya groper-ERG:pt(A) yg.man.ABS(O) grab.in.passing-PAST turtle.ABS(O) dama-l-dama-nya. spear-REDUP-SUB 'The groper grabbed in passing the chap spearing turtles. '
- (460) Buliman-angka nyunguny kuni-ny, wanarri-nya. police-ERG:pt(A) 3sg.ACC(0) hit-PAST run.REDUP-SUB 'The policeman shot him while he (i.e. the victim) was running.'

The following is an example where 0 is co-referential with the S of a subordinate antipassive:

(46 1) Ngayu kadar kungkunbunga-l-bunga-l, jikan-ba l sg.NOM(A) wallaby.ABS(O) watch-l-REDUP-NONPAST grass-LOC nuka-nuka-ji-nya. eat-REDUP-ITR-SUB 'I am watching the wallaby feeding on grass.'

In the above sentences the deletion pattern seems to single out the 0 NP. This could be appropriately expressed by a relative clause in English, e.g. (458) 'he watched the Chinese who was digging for gold' or (459) 'the groper grabbed the chap who was spearing turtles'. The preferred word order in the main clause of such sentences is AOV, as shown above, although AVO has also been heard occasionally.

Now compare the following sentences where the 0 NP is deleted in the main clause and the co-referential A or S NP retained in the subordinate clause. Here the emphasis lies on the action described in the subordinate clause as illustrated by the translations:

(462) Bama-ngka nyaji-l-nyaji-ny, janiman-angka gold Aborigine-ERG:pt(A) see-l-REDUP-PAST Chinese-ERG:pt(A) gold.ABS(O) baka-l-baka-nya. dig-l-REDUP-SUB 'The Aborigine watched while/how the Chinese was digging for gold.' (463) Ngayu nyaji-ny, nyulu bulki yaka-l-yaka-nya. I sg.NOM(A) see-PAST 3sg.NOM(A) bullock.ABS(O) cut.up-l-REDUP-SUB 'I saw how he cut up the bullock [carcass].'

(464) *Maral-angka nyaji-l-nyaji-ny, bama* girl-ERG:pt(A) see-*l*-REDUP-PAST Aborigine.ABS(S) corroboree wuri-n-wuri-nya. dance-REDUP-SUB warrma 'The girl watched while/how the Aborigines danced a corroboree.'

(465) Karrkay-angka nyaji-ny, jarba kuni-ji-nya. child-ERG:pt(A) see-PAST snake.ABS(S) kill-ITR-SUB 'The child saw the snake being killedlhow the snake was killed. '

In the last example the deleted main clause 0 is co-referential with the S of an agentless passive construction.

Just as a retained 0 NP is inseparable from the main clause, as illustrated previously, a retained subordinate S/A NP must be contiguous to the rest of the subordinate clause.

Note that deletion of the main clause 0 NP is apparently only possible if the main verb is a verb of perception such as nyaji-l 'see, hear' or kungkun-bunga-l 'watch closely'. This suggests that the entire subordinate clause is seen in object function, whereas a subordinate clause in which the AlS NP is deleted seems to relativise the 0 NP of the main clause. (This will be discussed in more detail in §4.4.5.) If the subordinate clause in its entirety is in 0 function one may argue that the clause as a whole takes absolutive case clause finally on the verb + -nyV form. This cannot be verified since absolutive has zero realisation; however, evidence in (466b) and (467b), scant as it is, may support this theory. Simultaneous action constructions in which the main clause oblique object is co-referential with the subordinate S/A NP are quite rare, but consider the following examples:

(466) a. N gayu wulman-anda dunga-y, yinyay bundanda-nya. 1 sg.NOM(S) old.man -LOC:pt go-NONP AST there sit.REDUP-SUB 'I go to the old man (who is?) sitting there.'

b. N gayu dungay wulmananda bundanda-nya-mun-bu. sit.REDUP-SUB-mun-LOC

'I go to the sitting old man.'

(467) a. lana warri-y(,) jalbu-ndu(,) mayi 3pl.NOM(S) run-NONPAST woman-LOC:pt food.ABS(O) cook-SUB 'They run to the woman (who is?) cooking food.' waju-nyu.

b. lana warriy jalbundu mayi waju-nyu-mun-bu. cook -SUB-mun-LOC

'They run to the food-cooking woman.'

It appears that in the a. sentences the subordinate S/A NP is deleted, and the remaining subordinate clause modifies the oblique object. But note that there is no case agreement with the oblique object. In the b. sentences it seems that the entire subordinate clause fulfils oblique object function since the whole clause takes locative marking. Verb + -nyV in this context can in fact be interpreted as a kind of adjective. (Note that the -nyV stem takes neutral case marking following the stem-forming suffix -mun-, whereas 'normal' adjectives take potent inflection in connection with a potent-inflected noun.) However, it remains unclear what (if anything) is deleted where in these examples. The few sentences available do not shed any light on this.

Where simultaneous actions are performed by the same actor, S/A is co-referential with S'/A'. Unlike sentences with common O = S/A NP', which can delete the common NP in either the main or subordinate clause, same-actor sentences apparently allow deletion only in the subordinate clause. This assumption is based on evidence from sentences with crossfunctional common NPs, i.e. S = A' or A = S'. Where S = S' or A = A', it is not discernable which NP is deleted, not even by intonation. The truncated subordinate clause may be embedded in or follow the main clause.

The form of the subordinate verb in these sentences depends largely on whether the main clause is intransitive or transitive. If the main clause is transitive, the subordinate verb optionally takes neutral ergative inflection if the subordinate clause is embedded, and it must do so if the subordinate clause follows the main clause. Thus from an underlying structure:

[A NPI 0 NP verbIJ L [s or A NPI (0 NP) verb2] L'

we obtain either

[A NP O NP [(O NP) verb2-nyV (-ERG)] Σ' verb1] Σ [(0 NP) verb2-nyV-ERG] L'

For example:

A = S'

In the above sentences the subordinate clauses are embedded in the main clause and ergative inflection on the verb + -nya form is optional. Now consider:

nuka-I-nuka-nya-mun-du. eat-l-REDUP-SUB-mun-ERG 'Mother looks after the baby while [she is] eating. '

Here the subordinate clauses follow the main clause and ergative inflection is obligatory.

Because of the ergative inflection on the verb + -nyV forms, the subordinate clause may be regarded as an attribute to the main clause NP. In some cases the subordinate clause could also be interpreted as referring to the manner in which something is done, as for instance in (470), and (47 1 ), which would justify the term "participle clause" used by R. Hershberger (1 979:79). Where A NP and attributive subordinate clause are contiguous, the need for ergative inflection is not so great, since the sentence cannot be interpreted in any other way than A = A'/S'. If, however, the subordinate clause stands sentence-finally, it must be clearly identified as 'belonging to' the main A NP, because in this position it could just as well be coreferential with the main 0 NP. For instance, compare (472) with (464); without the ergative inflection in (472) it would be ambiguous who is doing what in either sentence. Or take (460), which implies that the victim was running. To indicate that the policeman was running, the subordinate verb must take ergative inflection:

(474) Bulimanangka nyunguny kuniny, wanarri-nya-mun-du policeman-ERG:pt(A) 3sg.ACC(O) hit.PAST run-REDUP-SUB-mun-ERG 'The policeman shot him while he (the policeman) was running.'

If the main clause is intransitive and  $S = S'/A'$ , the verb + -nyV form is not further inflected, or one may say that the subordinate verb+ -nyV form is in absolutive case for which inflection is zero. Examples of embedded subordinate clauses where  $S = S'$  and  $S = A'$  are:

 $S = S'$ 

- (475) Yinya yarraman janjana-nya warngku-wunana-y. that.ABS(S) horse.ABS(S) stand.REDUP-SUB.ABS(S) sleep-lie.REDUP-NONPAST 'That horse sleeps standing up. '

# 4.4. 4.2 Causal

In causal subordinate clauses[37](#page-37-1) the verb + -nyV form does not allow case inflections and can therefore not be regarded as a nominal as in the other subordinate clauses containing this

<sup>37</sup> See R. Hershberger (1970:8 1 9-820) 'Causative Sentence'.

form. (Note that a noun in causal function takes ablative; see §4. 1 .4.4 (iv).) The causal action is understood to be completed and prior in time to the main verb. Of course, a simultaneous action may also sometimes imply a logical cause, for example:

(483) Ngayu muku kaka, baya muja-l-muja-nya. I sg.NOM(S) back.ABS pain.ABs firewood.ABS(O) gather-l-REDUP-SUB.ABS(S) 'I have a sore back while/from gathering firewood.'

Here, the gathering of firewood is presumably also the cause of the backache, but emphasis in this case lies in the coinciding of both events as compared to:

(484) Ngayu muku kaka, baya muja-nya yilayku. I sg.NOM(S) back.ABS pain.ABS firewood.ABS(O) gather-sUB yesterday 'I have a sore back from gathering firewood yesterday. '

Here the past firewood collection is the cause of the backache which still persists at the time of utterance.

A causal clause may precede or follow the main clause. Treatment of common NPs in main and causal clause is somewhat different to that in previously discussed subordinate constructions. The following common NPs are possible:

> $S$  or  $A = S'$  or  $A'$  O = O' or S' or A'

But consistent deletion of the subordinate NP occurs only where S = S' or A', for instance:

S = S'

(485) Janji-nya, nyulu bajaburray. bathe-SUB 3sg.NOM(S) tired 'He is tired from bathing. '

### S = A'

(486) Mayi durrba-nya, nyulu manu jayba-ny. food.ABS(O) gobble-sUB 3sg.NOM(S) throat.ABS(S) get.stuck-PAST 'He choked from gobbling down food.'

Another example of S = A' is in (483).

Where a causal clause NP is co-referential with the A or 0 NP of the main clause, the use of a pronoun is preferred for clarity, although deletion is possible. For example:

A = S'

(487) *Buliman-angka nganya kari nyaji-ny*, (*nyulu*) *warngku-wuna-nya*. police-ERG:pt(A) 1sg.ACC(O) NEG see-PAST 3sg.NOM(S) sleep-lie-SUB 'The policeman did not see me because [he] was asleep.'

Without the anaphoric pronoun this sentence would be ambiguous as to who was asleep.

$$\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{A}\text{ " and } \mathbf{O} = \mathbf{O}\text{" }$$

On first sight (490) is still ambiguous since the anaphoric pronoun could just as well refer to 'father', and the same would apply if the agent in (489) were also third person singular. In such instances the context of the utterance will disambiguate the sentence, or the most plausible interpretation would apply. For instance it would be unlikely that father is scolding his child because he (the father) kicked the dog.

# 4.4.4.3 Prior event

The previous section discussed expression of events that are prior in time as well as causal with relation to another event. In this section we will look at subordinate clauses which indicate events that precede another event but do not have any causal effect. These can be generalised as 'X does Y after having done Z'. The prior action is expressed by *wawu* + verb + -nyV + Ablative. (For temporal proclitic *wawu*- see §3.10.1). As illustrated in §4.1.4.4 (iv), ablative indicates, among other things, a (locational or) temporal starting point which has been left behind by the actor, which means that the preceding action is thought to be completed.

A prior-event clause with verb + -nyV form may precede or follow the main clause, but it is only possible if the following NPs are co-referential:

$$\begin{array}{l} \mathsf{S} = \mathsf{S}'\\ \bullet = \mathsf{S}' \text{ or } \mathsf{A}' \text{ (if also: } \mathsf{A} = \mathsf{O}') \end{array}$$

The co-referential NP is deleted in the subordinate clause.

S = S'

(49 1) Wawu-janji-nya-muny, jana wunana-y. TEMP4-bathe-SUB-ABL 3pl.NOM(S) lie.REDUP-NONPAST 'After bathing, they have a rest.'

O = S'

(492) Nganjin jalbu nyaji-ny, wawu-wala-nya-muny. Ipl.exc.NOM(A) woman.ABS(O) see-PAST TEMP4-enter-SUB-ABL 'We saw the woman after [she] had come in.'

O = A' and A = O'

(493) Dingkar-angka jinkalmu kuni-ny, wawu-bayka-nya-muny. man-ERG:pt(A) brown.snake.ABS(O) kill-PAST lliMP4-bite-sUB-ABL 'The man killed the Brown Snake after [it] had bitten [him].'

Where main and subordinate clause share a common NP in S and A function respectively, the subordinate A NP is deleted, but it is the subordinate 0 or oblique object NP which takes ablative marking while the verb remains unchanged, as for example:

- (494) Ngayu wunana-ny, wawu-kambi-muny julurri-ny. I sg.NOM(S) lie.REDUP-PAST lliMP4-clotheS-ABL wash-PAST 'I had a rest after washing clothes. '
- (495) Nyulu jilba-dunga-ny, wawu-jukijuki-muny mayi daji-ny. 3sg.NOM(S) walk-go-PAST lliMP4-chicken-ABL food.ABS(O) give-PAsT 'She went for a walk after having fed the chickens.'

Note that the oblique object in the subordinate clause in (495) does not receive locative case marking before the ablative inflection as would be required in a simple sentence 'she gave food to the chickens (-LOC)' (see §4.1 .4.4 (iii) example (272)).

It could be argued that wawu- -muny in the subordinate clause attaches to the first word and that the subordinate verb is nominalised (by -nyV) only if it must bear case inflection. As a rule, ablative marking is attracted by nouns away from a verb + -nyV form. Therefore, if an event can possibly be expressed by a nominal, this must be used to indicate the prior event; a verb + -nyV form is unacceptable if an alternative noun is available. For instance:

| (497)                                                                                                                                    | <i>Nyulu</i><br>3sg.NOM(A)            | <i>bana</i><br>water.ABS(O) | <i>nuka-ny</i><br>drink-PAST  | <i>wawu-jilba-muny</i> /<br>TEMP4-walk-ABL              |

\*wawu-dunga-nya-muny. lliMP4-go-SUB-ABL 'She drank some water after the walk.'

Apparently a prior-event subordinate construction is not possible if a main clause A NP is co-referential with a subordinate A or S NP, presumably because co-referential O = S'/A' and A = S'/A' could be confused (see (492)). To express that the referent of an A NP has performed another action previously, this action may be indicated by a noun in ablative case, as for instance in (497), or two clauses are simply conjoined, using the general expression wawu-yinya-muny 'after that'.

### 4. 4. 4.4 Hypothetical reason

Purposive and precautionary (see §4.4.1 and §4.4.2) constructions express real reasons for which something is done. These reasons are real because the events indicated by purposive or precautionary are definitely expected to happen. Kuku Yalanji has also a means of

# 180 Chapter 4

expressing a hypothetical reason because of which something else is done. This may be generalised as 'X does Y just in case Z happens'. The hypothetical reason 'Z' is expressed by verb + -nyV + -Dative (cf. function of Dative as indicator of general reason §4.1.4.4 (ii)). For example:

| (498)                                                                | <i>Jana</i><br>3pl.NOM(S)  | <i>kari</i><br>NEG               | <i>dunga-y,</i><br>go-NONPAST   | <i>kaba</i><br>rain.ABS(S)                   | <i>kada-nya-mun-ku.</i><br>come-SUB-mun-DAT |

Very often the subordinate clause is introduced by particle kunka 'in case', as in (499), or less commonly by nganganjirrka 'just in case'.

In the previous examples there are no common NPs, but co-referentiality of NPs is certainly possible. However it is not obligatory, nor indeed preferred, to delete any of them. Instead, pronoun reduction is commonly applied. Naturally, if co-referential NPs are retained in some form or other, co-referentiality need not be restricted. However, hypothetical reason constructions with common NP are few and far between and only the following possibilities have been attested:

A = S'

Hypothetical reason clauses are regarded as somewhat cumbersome and are generally avoided in discourse, those with common NPs more so than those without. It is preferred to express the possibility of an event by an independent clause containing nguba 'perhaps' (see §3.9.2 (iii) and §4.9.3) which may in context be interpreted as the reason for another action, for example:
