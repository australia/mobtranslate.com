### Abbreviations and conventions

Examples consist of three parts:

(a) Kuku Yalanji sentence

The following conventions are used:

- morpheme boundary
- / alternative forms
- ( ) optional material
- { } different morphemes in Yalanji and Nyungkul dialects
- " " direct speech
- clause boundary in co-ordinate and subordinate constructions
- \* ungrammatical sentence or word form
- ? not attested but presumably possible sentence, or construction that is considered awkward although grammatical
- primary and secondary word stress respectively
- I " primary and secondary clause stress respectively

#### (b) Interlinear glosses

These are lined up with the beginning of each Kuku Yalanji word. As far as possible direct translations or semantic approximations have been used for free and bound morphemes alike. Where such translations would have resulted in confusion with other lexical items, abbreviations of the grammatical function have been used. Groups of bound morphemes with similar function but different semantic contents are also indicated by abbreviations referring to the respective function. A list of abbreviations is set out below.

#### (c) Translations

The following conventions are used:

- [ ] items that can be inferred from the Kuku Yalanji sentence
- ( ) editorial comments
- / alternative translations
- " " verbatim translations by speakers or, in context, direct speech

For stylistic reasons English translations contain article the, regardless of whether the Kuku Yalanji example implies definiteness or not. For ease of reading the is not enclosed in parentheses.

# Acknowledgements

I wish to record my deepest gratitude to the Kuku Yalanji people at Wujal Wujal, who accepted me with friendliness and generosity both as a researcher and as a temporary resident in their community. I cannot name all of my helpers here, but I owe special thanks to Charlie Tayley, Bobby Roberts, Louisa Smith, Ruby Friday, Ivy Walker and my babarr Mabel Webb for their unflagging enthusiasm in teaching me their language with intelligence, sensitivity and patience. Long hours of repetitive and tiring work were alleviated by their sense of humour, entertaining anecdotes and activities like forays for bush tucker in which they gladly allowed me to participate. Kuku Yalanji speakers of the Mossman Gorge Mission and the Mareeba settlement, in particular Norman Mitchell, also contributed material.

Hank and Ruth Hershberger of the Summer Institute of Linguistics kindly co-operated with me during fieldwork, comparing notes and making some of their unpublished material a vailable to me.

At The Australian National University I was very fortunate to have the assistance of Professor R.M.W. Dixon, who had introduced me to Australian linguistics, and Dr Harold Koch. They supervised my study with interest and enthusiasm, providing constructive comments and guidance.

During fieldwork I received financial and material assistance in the form of transport and accommodation from The Australian National University and the then Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies.

Mission staff at Mossman, Mareeba and Wujal Wujal, in particular Mr Ed Stephan and Mrs Lydia Stephan, were most hospitable and contributed a great deal to making my visits successful.

For all this help I am most grateful.

## Foreword

Kuku Yalanji, spoken in the area between Mossman and Cooktown in North Queensland, is still a living language. Only about two score of the original 250 distinct Australian Aboriginal languages are still learned by children; Kuku Yalanji is one of them, although its use as the main means of communication in the home has diminished during the past twenty years. This publication is intended to provide a record of the grammar of this language and to make Kuku Yalanji publicly accessible.

This study, based on research undertaken from 1 979 to 1 981, was originally submitted for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in The Australian National University in December 1 982. (Necessary revision according to examiners' recommendations has been undertaken.) Personal reasons prevented earlier publication; but in the meantime the continued dwindling of Aboriginal language resources on the one hand, and some partial success in a painstaking revival of Kuku Yalanji's southern neighbour Djabugay on the other, led to an increased sense of urgency.

Availability of sound language material has played a role in revival efforts of Djabugay. Reduced to only a couple of fluent speakers by the late seventies, Djabugay has been regaining significance for tribal identity and pride since 1 989 through a language course developed by teacher Michael Quinn in cooperation with Djabugay speaker Robert Banning and other members of the Djabugay community. The language course is primarily based on the sketch grammar written as my Honours thesis in 1 978 and the accompanying taperecorded and written material. Publication of the grammar of Djabugay in 1991 in volume 4 of the Handbook of Australian Languages provided a boost to the language program.

Kuku Yalanji was estimated to have about 300 speakers in 1 990 and it was, and still is, supported by Language Other Than English (LOTE) courses in the Bloomfield River State School and Mossman High School. However, even in the 1 980s it was felt in the community that it was more important for children to speak English at home than Kuku. This makes sense from a pragmatic point of view, but concentration on the dominant language at the expense of the vernacular often creates new problems, namely eventual loss of cultural identity. The effects of the shift towards English as main medium of communication are already being felt. At present not many of the about ninety Kuku Yalanji primary school children are fluent in their language when they enter the LOTE program in grade three.

This grammar is intended to give an accurate and comprehensive description of the components of this language and its grammatical rules to readers with some knowledge of linguistics. While there is some discussion of theoretical issues, the grammar is not cast in a particular theoretical framework; nor does it extend into sociolinguistic analysis. It will serve as a database for the theoretical linguist, or as the necessary background for the scholar

Significant characteristics of this language that are of particular interest to the linguist include:

- vowel-harmony rules,
- two sets of case endings governed by animacy,
- passive and anti-passive constructions,
- treatment of topic and anaphoric devices in narrative discourse.

The language Kuku Yalanji comprised several dialects; only two of these are still in use, Yalanji and NyungkuL This study is concerned with both dialects, recording any differences that have been observed.
