are distinguished by duration. A vowel has continuing articulation, whereas a semivowel is characterised by momentary articulation which is produced by a quick movement towards and/or away from the corresponding vowel-type stricture (Catford 1 97 7:131, 165). Semivowel /w/ before or after vowel /u/ is acoustically distinct from the vowel, due to a higher degree of lip rounding and presumably also a narrowing of the cross-section between the articulators in the velar region. Semivowel /y/ before or after vowel /i/ is distinct from the vowel only by a narrowing of the articulatory cross-section by raising the anterodorsal part of the tongue. (Strictly speaking, semivowel /y/ is not a lamino-palatal sound, since a section of the tongue just behind the blade area is involved in articulation. However, to distinguish Iyl from apical and dorsal consonants, I have included it in the lamino-palatal column in the consonant chart.)

Initial /y/ before vowel /i/ or /a/ may be dropped (that is the vowel may be pronounced without the initial onglide) and younger speakers, up to about 20 years of age, have even been recorded as substituting glottal stop for Iyl in this position. Thus there are three alternative pronunciations for words beginning with /y/ followed by /i/ or /a/, for example:

> yinya, inya, ?inya 'that' yanyu, anyu, ?anyu 'this'

Semivowel /y/ after /i/ word-finally or before another consonant is always deleted (see §2.5.2).

Initial /w/ before /a/ is clearly pronounced (there are no examples of initial /w/ before /i/), whereas initial Iwl before lui may be dropped, giving the two alternatives:

wunba, unba 'English bee',

but no glottal stop has been recorded in this position in place of Iw/.

### 2. 1.2 Vowels

Kuku Yalanji has the common Australian inventory of three vowels: /a/, /u/ and /i/. As is characteristic for Australian vowels, they have 'pure' articulation and are never diphthongised in any way. There is no phonemic distinction of vowel length as in the neighbouring languages Dyabugay and Guugu Yimidhirr. Generally, vowels in Kuku Yalanji could be classified as short, with slightly longer allophones occurring in word-final position.

While some Australian languages with the same vowel system allow each vowel a fairly wide range of phonetic realisation (see Dixon 1 980: 1 30), Kuku Yalanji vowels show only little variation in different environments. Figure 2.1 shows the range of vowel realisation in Kuku Yalanji with \* marking the approximate place of articulation of the major allophone.2

The major allophone of vowel /a/ is more central and slightly higher than cardinal vowel /a/. Before velar consonants, lateral /l/, retroflex rhotic /r/ and semivowel /w/ it is pronounced a little further back, whereas before laminal consonants and semivowel /y/ it is slightly fronted and raised. The major allophone of vowel /i/ is less high and less front than cardinal vowel /i/ and is pronounced with spread lips. Before velar consonants, bilabial nasal /m/,

2 In my description of Kuku Yalanji vowels I follow the traditional vowel classification which is based on a correlation of highest point of the tongue and shaping of the lips as represented in stylised form in the vowel quadrilateral (O'Connor 1 973; Ladefoged 1 975; Catford 1 977).

## 22 Chapter 2

lateral /l/ and retroflex rhotic /r/ it is lowered somewhat and pronounced in a more central position with less lip spreading. The major allophone of vowel /u/ is more fronted and lowered than cardinal vowel /u/ and is pronounced with distinct lip rounding. It tends to be lowered in the same environment where /i/ is lowered, and is more fronted before palatal consonants, but distinct lip rounding applies throughout.

#### 2.2 Phonotactics

The majority of Kuku Yalanji roots are disyllabic. Except for three monosyllabic interjections there are no monosyllabic roots. In a word list of 1 340 roots3 there are 1 055 disyllabic and 200 trisyllabic roots, 81 roots with four syllables, and 4 roots with five syllables. All roots begin with a consonant and end in a consonant or a vowel. Thus the structure of Kuku Yalanji roots can be formalised as follows:

 $C\_1 (V C\_2)^n V (C\_3)$  where  $n \ge 1$ 

### 2.2. 1 Possibility of occurrence

The following vowels and consonants can occur in the different phonotactic positions in Kuku Yalanji root structure:

- V can be any vowel.
- $C\_1$  must be a single consonant and can be any stop, nasal or semivowel, i.e. /b, d, j, k, m, n, ny, ng, w, yl (see Figure 2.2). One word with initial rhotic IITI has been recorded, rrunyuji 'wise man with magic powers'. This word could perhaps have been part of a ceremonial speech style for which there is no more evidence today. Phonological patterns that are different from the everyday language are not unheard

<sup>3</sup> This word list is based on two sources: the large majority of entries were elicited by myself and a smaller number of lexical items is taken from the word list by W. Oates and L. Oates ( 1964b) and an unpublished preliminary word list by H. Hershberger and R. Hershberger (early 1 960s). Items from these lists were only included in my data after thorough checking with informants. The dictionary published by the Hershbergers in 1 982 has not been taken into account for this study.

of for such speech styles in Australian languages, although they are uncommon (see Dixon 1 980:60).

• C3 must be a single consonant and can be a non-peripheral nasal, the lateral, either rhotic or the lamino-palatal semi-vowel, i.e. In, ny, 1, rr, r, yl (see Figure 2.2).

![](_page_2_Figure_3.jpeg)

Figure 2.2: Initial and final consonants in Kuku Yalanji

• C2 can be:

(i) any single consonant, or a cluster of two or three consonants.

These clusters may be:

- (ii) a homorganic nasal/stop sequence, i.e. 1mb, nd, nyj, ngk/;
- (iii) apico-alveolar nasal Inl plus: a non-apical stop, or a peripheral nasal, i.e. Inb, nj, nk, nm, nng/;
- (iv) semi-vowel Iyl plus: a non-apical stop, or a bilabial nasal, or a peripheral homorganic nasal/stop sequence, i.e. Iyb, yj, yk, ym, ymb, yngk/;
- (v) lateral /l/ plus: a non-apical stop, or a peripheral nasal, or a homorganic nonapical nasal/stop sequence, i.e. lIb, lj, 1m, lng, 1mb, lnyj, lngk/;
- (vi) trilled rhotic Irrl plus: a peripheral stop, or a peripheral nasal, or a homorganic peripheral nasal/stop sequence, i.e. Irrb, rrk, rrm, rrng, rrmb, rrngk/;
- (vii) retroflex rho tic Irl plus: a peripheral stop, or a non-palatal nasal, or a homorganic non-palatal nasal/stop sequence, i.e. Irb, rk, rm, rn, rng, rmb, rnd, rngk/. Clusters Irnl and Irndl stand out from the general pattern of consonant clusters in Kuku Yalanji (see Table 2.2) and there are only one and two occurrences respectively which are:

| murnil  | 'stir, twist'                           |
|---------|-----------------------------------------|
| warndiy | 'get up from sitting or lying position' |
| kurndal | 'sink in mud or water'.                 |

| nb  | nj  | nk  | nm  | nng  |      |     |       |     |      |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|------|------|-----|-------|-----|------|
| yb  | yj  | yk  | ym  | ?    | ymb  | ?   | yngk  |     |      |
| lb  | lj  | lk  | lm  | lng  | lmb  | lnj | lngk  |     |      |
| rrb | (?) | rrk | rrm | rrng | rrmb | (?) | rrngk |     |      |
| rb  | (?) | rk  | rm  | rn   | rng  | rmb | rnd   | (?) | rngk |

Table 2.2: Heterorganic consonant clusters in Kuku Yalanji

Cluster IrndJ has been attested once in Dyabugay, (barndil 'child'), but no example of 1m! is known for Dyabugay. Neither cluster exists in Yidiny and Dyirbal, further south (Dixon 1 977:35 and 1 972:272-273 respectively), but they are present among the possibilities for consonant clusters in Guugu Yimidhirr to the north of Kuku Yalanji. However, these clusters do have some idiosyncracies in Guugu Yimidhirr in that Irnl may be pronounced as either a cluster of distinct sounds or as a single retroflex nasal, and Irndl as either a sequence of rhotic plus apical nasal and stop, or as retroflex nasal followed by retroflex stop, apparently in free variation (see Haviland 1 979a:37, 40; Dixon 1 980: 1 64). Apparently there are no cognates in Guugu Yimidhirr for the Kuku Yalanji words containing these clusters (Haviland, unpublished word list February 1 981) which makes borrowing from Guugu Yimidhirr into Kuku Yalanji appear unlikely. A more plausible assumption would be that these clusters are an area feature, albeit weak, in the three languages north of Cairns.

Clusters Iyngl and Iynyjl (marked '?') for which no examples have been attested, could reasonably be expected to exist in Kuku Yalanji according to the general pattern, and their absence here may just be accidental gaps in a relatively small word list of only 1 340 roots. The gaps marked by '(?)', on the other hand, are so symmetrical as to suggest the general rule that a rhotic may not be followed by a palatal consonant in Kuku Yalanji. This would represent a special feature of Kuku Yalanji, since northern and southern neighbouring languages do allow such sequences.

Possibilities for intermorphemic consonant clusters are less restricted than those for intra morphemic clusters. Thus in reduplicated forms, compounds, and some inflected forms we can find clusters across the root boundary that cannot occur within the root, I.e. combinations of C3 and Cl. For instance:

reduplicated forms:

| walbulwalbul | 'butterfly'           |
|--------------|-----------------------|
| dakaldakal   | 'trochus shell'       |
| nurilnuril   | 'keep looking inside' |

compounds:

| miyil-dandi    | 'sleepless' (lit. eye-hard) |
|----------------|-----------------------------|
| julbarr-warriy | 'slip' (lit. slippery-run)  |

Compounds are defined as such because they inflect as a whole, have primary stress on the first syllable (see §2.6.1 ), and no other morpheme such as a clitic or particle can be inserted between the two parts. Therefore the above examples can be regarded as one word, grammatical as well as phonological, although I hyphenise analysable compounds for clarity.

Inflected nominal forms showing further clusters are:

| dambalda  | 'boot-INST' |
|-----------|-------------|
| manyarrda | 'wife-ERG'  |

On the other hand, most inflected forms avoid any kind of consonant cluster across the morpheme boundary by inserting a vowel between a root-final consonant and the inflection, for example:

| bama-ngka   | 'Aborigine-ERG' |
|-------------|-----------------|
| maral-angka | 'girl-ERG'      |
| bama-nda    | 'Aborigine-LOC' |
| maral-anda  | 'girl-LOC'      |

One restriction on intermorphernic consonant clusters is that Kuku Yalanji does not allow geminate consonants, so that a cluster of two identical consonants is reduced to one consonant. For instance, in the reduplication of y-conjugation verbs consonant /n/ is inserted between the roots (see §3.8.5.5 (ii) (a)). If the root begins with /n/, the resulting cluster /nn/ is reduced to single /n/, for example:

*nuka-n-nuka-ji-y* ‘keep eating (itr)’

## → *nuka-nuka-ji-y*.

Bound morphemes, that is inflections, derivations and clitics, differ in their structure from roots in that they are frequently monosyllabic and may even consist of a single consonant or vowel. Disyllabic bound morphemes conform to the phonotactic occurrence possibilities of roots, whereas monosyllabic bound morphemes show some variation: they may begin with a consonant cluster, e.g. potent ergative -*ngkV*, potent locative -*ndV*, and there is one occurrence of morpheme-initial lateral in clitic -*lu*/-*la*. (The presence of initial vowel in a bound morpheme, something which is not possible for a root, is conditioned by root-final consonant, e.g. potent ergative -*VngkV/C*-, and should therefore not be regarded as a special feature of bound morphemes that goes against the general phonotactic conventions.)

### 2.2.2 Probability of occurrence

The various phonemes of Kuku Yalanji have different relative probability of occurrence, partly depending on the presence of other phonemes within the same word. Occurrence rates for Kuku Yalanji phonemes are based on a lexicon of 1 340 roots (excluding the phonetically unusual form rrunyuji 'wise man with magic powers').

The relative frequency of the three vowels in Kuku Yalanji is listed in Table 2.3. The percentages in this table show that overall /*a*/ is more frequent than /*u*/, which in turn is more frequent than /*i*/. The relatively higher occurrence of /*i*/ over /*u*/ in third and fourth vowel positions can be wholly accounted for by the fact that a number of nominal roots with more than two syllables appear to be fossilised comitative forms ending in -*ji*, and several verb roots of more than two syllables are reinterpreted roots ending in -*rri* (see [§3.8.3.2](#page-3-8) (ii)).

|               | a     | u     | i     |
|---------------|-------|-------|-------|
| 1 st syllable | 46.6% | 35.2% | 18.2% |
| 2nd syllable  | 54.2% | 27.1% | 18.7% |
| 3rd syllable  | 42.3% | 19.8% | 37.9% |
| 4th syllable  | 61.1% | 18.9% | 20.0% |

Table 2.3: Relative frequency of Kuku Yalanji vowels

Looking at the distribution of vowels in first and second vowel position of a root, we find that vowels follow each other with either higher or lower frequency than could be expected. For instance, 35.2% of roots have vowel /*u*/ in first position and 27.1% have /*u*/ in second position. If there was no association between vowels in first and second position, we would expect  $0.352 \times 0.271 = 0.095$ , i.e. 9.5% or 128 roots to have /*u*/ in both first and second vowel position. In fact, there are 200 roots, or 14.9%, with /*u*/ as first and second vowel. Thus the actual-to-expected ratio of /*u*/ following /*u*/ is  $0.149 \pm 0.095 = 1.57$ . In other words, /u/ follows /u/ more often than expected, and we can say that vowel /u/ has positive association with following vowel lui. The actual-to-expected ratio for each vowel cooccurrence is listed in Table 2.4. These figures show that each vowel in Kuku Yalanji has highest association with the same vowel and relatively lesser association with any other vowel, as set out in Table 2.5. Note that the markedly highest association is between /u/ and /u/, whereas /i/ has some positive association with /a/, although less than with /i/, but overall the least association with /u/.

Table 2.4: Actual-to-expected ratio of vowel co-occurrence in first and second vowel position

|                   | Second position |      |      |      |
|-------------------|-----------------|------|------|------|
|                   | a               | u    | i    |      |
| First<br>position | a               | 1.13 | 0.73 | 0.93 |
|                   | u               | 0.79 | 1.57 | 0.79 |
|                   | i               | 1.04 | 0.59 | 1.47 |

Table 2.5: Relative association between vowels in Kuku Yalanji

|   | greatest<br>association with | medium<br>association with | least<br>association with |
|---|------------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|
| a | a                            | i                          | u                         |
| u | u                            |                            | a, i                      |
| i | i                            | a                          | u                         |

This pattern is interesting with regard to the vowel-harmony rule for suffixes (see §2.S. I) which requires that /a/ and /i/ be followed by /a/, and /u/ be followed by /u/. It appears that this vowel-harmony rule reflects to some extent the general tendency of vowel co-occurrence within roots.4

Occurrence rates for initial and final consonants are given in Table 2.6. Final consonants are counted only for non-verbal roots, since all verb roots end in a vowel with the final consonants -y and -*l* in citation form being conjugation markers. Adjectives and nouns each show a slightly higher rate of consonant-final than of vowel-final roots; that is, there is no structural difference between adjectives and nouns concerning the final root constituent. Of a total of 1066 noun and adjective roots, 53% end in a consonant and 47% in a vowel.

It can be seen that more than half of all roots begin with a stop. The most frequent initial segment is *k* and the least frequent *n*. Of the 582 roots that end in a consonant more than half show a liquid in final position. Lateral /*l*/ is overall the most favoured consonant in final position. According to place of articulation, the most frequent consonants root-initially are labials, followed by palatals and velars with equal occurrence rates, the least frequent consonants are alveolars. The latter, however, have the highest occurrence rate root-finally (owing to the high frequency of liquids). Overall the least common initial consonants are non-peripheral nasals, with palatal nasal Inyl also being quite rare root-finally.

Table 2.6: Frequency rates of initial and final consonants by place and manner of articulation

4 A similar pattern of weak vowel association with roots can be found in Guugu Yimidhirr (Haviland 1979a:39), which also has a vowel-harmony rule for imperative suffixes on -rr conjugation verbs.

The distribution of single consonants and consonant clusters in C2 position shows the following pattern: Liquids and stops  $/j/$  and  $/k/$  occur with highest frequency. Bilabial stop  $/b/$  is the next most common consonant in medial position, followed in frequency by semivowels, bilabial nasal  $/m/$ , apical stop and nasal  $/d/$  and  $/n/$ , and velar nasal  $/\text{ng}/$  in this order. The least frequent single consonant in C2 is laminal nasal  $/\text{ny}/$ . Among 574 occurrences of consonant clusters, homorganic nasal/stop sequences are the most common ones with an occurrence rate of 34%. Clusters with the lateral or rhotic Irrl as first component followed by a peripheral stop are also fairly frequent (26%). All other clusters have an occurrence rate of less than 5%, the least common being Inm! and Inngl (twice each), Irnl (once) and Irndl (twice), and Iym! (twice), (ranging between 0. 17 and 0.34%).

On the whole there is no clear association in Kuku Yalanji between a consonant and a following or preceding vowel (unlike in Dyirbal; see Dixon 1 972:28 1 -283). The actual occurrence rates for CV and VC combinations generally follow the pattern of expected occurrence rates with only a very slight tendency toward positive association between consonants and vowels that are close in place of articulation and negative association between consonants and vowels that are more distant in articulation. This tendency is most obvious for velar consonants and semivowels. Initial velar stop and nasal  $/k/$  and  $/\text{ng}/$  and semivowel  $/w/$  are markedly less often followed by front vowel  $/i/$  than could be expected, whereas semivowel  $/y/$  is markedly less often followed by back round vowel  $/u/$ . In these cases the consonant clearly has least association with the vowel that is most distant in articulation. VC sequences  $/\text{ing}/$  and  $/iy/$ , on the other hand, show a surprising departure from this general pattern. Sequence lingl occurs with 1.1 % frequency, whereas only 0.8% would have been expected, and liyl shows less than expected frequency (0.5% versus expected 1.6%). The latter discrepancy may be accounted for by the fact that  $/y/$  after  $/i/$  word-finally or before another consonant is lost (see §2.5.2). But there is no apparent clue to the reason for the relatively high occurrence of sequence ling!.

# 2.3 Phonological adaptation of English loan words5

When the Kuku Yalanji people came into contact with European civilisation they used two strategies for naming newly introduced commodities. One way was to extend the meaning of Kuku Yalanji words to describe these novelties, as for instance, kambi 'flying fox' for 'clothes' (the flying fox wraps its wings around itself when at rest), diburr 'eggs' for 'bullets', mayi karraji 'fruit with strings' for 'mangoes' (mangoes hang off the tree on long string-like stalks), orjiri-burr 'through the sky' for 'aeroplane'.

Another way of naming things was to use their English name, appropriately adapted to Kuku Yalanji phonology. This process of phonological adaptation, however, seems to have ceased about one generation ago (see Donaldson 1 980:62), presumably with the increase of Kuku Yalanji I English bilingualism. Nowadays one frequently hears words like 'car', 'aeroplane', 'church', 'store', or 'soft-drink' in the Kuku Yalanji discourse of younger speakers, usually with appropriate inflectional affixes (see §3. 1 2), but without phonological adaptation. This new trend also includes the frequent borrowing of English verbs and adjectives, which apparently was not commonly done in the earlier days, again with

<sup>5</sup> For a detailed discussion of this topic see Dixon, Ramson and Thomas ( 1990), Chapter 5 'Borrowings into Australian languages'.

l

morphological, but not phonological adaptation, such as fix-im-bungal, shift-mal-mal, workmani-jiy, or blue-bala, dirty-bala (see §3.12).

Only older speakers (roughly over 60 years of age), who are less proficient in English, still modify some newer words to some extent (usually not totally), e.g. telelzision, or job job for the community's favourite television program in 1 980 Cop Shop. The vocabulary of such older speakers also contains phonologically well-adapted loan words from the earlier contact period (which usually have English pronunciation among the younger speakers), e.g. bulawu 'flour', banabul 'pineapple', mudaka 'motorcar', juka 'sugar'.

Only about a score of English loans have become an integral part of the Kuku Yalanji lexicon. From these, and from the few adaptations still made by older speakers, we can glean the following nine generalisations on phonological change in English loan words (see Dixon 1 972:326):

(i) Kuku Yalanji stops b and j correspond to English fricatives that are closest in place of articulation, i.e. /b/ corresponds to /v, f/ and /j/ to /s, z, ʃ, ʒ/, for example:

| naybu | 'knife'       |
|-------|---------------|
| aybi  | 'Ivy (name)'  |
| buji  | 'pussy (cat)' |
| juka  | 'sugar'       |
| maji  | 'matches'     |

An interesting loan which cannot be placed with any amount of certainty is binjin 'petrol'. I have not been able to ascertain an early use of English benzene for petrol, and it might be possible that this is a loan from German, Benzin 'petrol', introduced by the German missionaries.

- (ii) English voiceless and aspirated stops become unaspirated and usually voiced, e.g. *dubayku* 'tobacco', *muduka* 'motorcar'. (Note that k in Kuku Yalanji normally represents voiced [g].) The characteristic acoustic features of changes (i) and (ii) were aptly described by my informant Bobby Roberts, who said: "English people say 'pussycat'. Bama say that word too, but we say it lightly way, we don't say phussi or phussikhath, but buji or bujiga".
- (iii) English It I and lsi before a velar stop become Kuku Yalanji IITI, as in marrkin 'musket (rifle)' and warrkin '(a place name) from 'Watkins' (name of an English settler)'.
- (iv) English consonant clusters consisting of a stop or fricative plus a sonorant are broken up by insertion of a vowel, for example:

| jarruja | 'trousers'       |

| gilaja  | 'glass (mirror)' |
| bulawu  | 'flour'          |
| banabul | 'pineapple'      |

If an initial cluster is broken up in this way, the inserted vowel is stressed according to the word-stress rule (see §2.6. 1 ), e.g. jarruja. (Examples are too few to determine rules for the choice of vowel that is inserted.) An initial fricativelstop consonant cluster, on the other hand, is simplified by dropping the first consonant, e.g. buwun 'spoon' (which is the only example in my data).

- (v) English loans with initial vowel are preceded by a semivowel which is Iwl before a back vowel and Iyl before a front or central vowel, for example:

| wulman   | 'old man' |
|----------|-----------|
| yalibala | 'early'   |

- (vi) An initial consonant which is not permitted in Kuku Yalanji phonotactics, but which is retained in loan words, is lateral /l/, e.g. *landin* 'Landing' (name for the confluence of Thompson Creek and Bloomfield River where there used to be a landing ramp). No loans with original initial rhotic have been attested.
- (vii) Monosyllabic English roots are made disyllabic by either inserting a semivowel sequence within the root:

| buwun | 'spoon'         |
|-------|-----------------|
| biyin | '(safety) pin', |

or by adding a final vowel, if the original or adapted root ends in a stop, for example:

| biki (or bikibiki) | 'pig'          |
|--------------------|----------------|
| juki               | 'chook, (hen)' |
| baybu              | 'pipe'         |
| naybu              | 'knife'        |

(Again, no generalisation on the choice of final vowel is possible.)

- (viii) Final consonants that are not possible in Kuku Yalanji phonotactics are adapted in the following way:
	- (a) by adding a vowel after an original or adapted stop as in (vii) and also gilaji 'glass', mijiji 'Mrs';
	- (b) by changing a stop to a corresponding nasal, as in marrkin 'musket';
	- (c) by changing a peripheral nasal to a non-peripheral one, as in landin 'Landing';
	- (d) or by simply dropping the final consonant, as injarruja 'trousers', bujika 'pussycat', warrkin 'Watkins'.
- (ix) The examples in my data do not give sufficient evidence for a generalisation on the adaptation of vowels, except to say that Kuku Yalanji vowels on the whole approximate the English vowel, and that English [E] or [re] and diphthong [ail before a consonant tend to become layl in Kuku Yalanji, e.g. mayngku 'mango', dubayka 'tobacco', baybu 'pipe'.

### 2.4 Phonetic rules - assimilation

There are three regressive assimilation rules in Kuku Yalanji. These are:

There are three regressive assim

(i) 

$$a, u \rightarrow a^{i}, u^{i} / - \begin{Bmatrix} ny \\ j \end{Bmatrix}$$

(ii)  $n \rightarrow n\_j$  / -j (iii)  $k \rightarrow k^w$  / -u

These rules apply with varying degrees of consistency among speakers.
