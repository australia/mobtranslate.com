## 4.4 Subordinate clauses

A clause is understood to be subordinate to another clause if it cannot be uttered independently; in other words, a subordinate clause must be directly adjoined to a main or superordinate clause. (Sometimes a subordinate clause by itself may constitute the answer to a question where the question can be regarded as the main clause, e.g. 'Why do you go to the river? - To catch fish' (purposive clause) or 'Why do you take a stick? - Lest the dog attack me' (precautionary clause).) Functionally, we can distinguish seven different types of subordinate clauses in Kuku Yalanji expressing the following concepts: 1. purposive, 2. precautionary, 3. successive, 4. simultaneous action, 5. causal, 6. prior event, 7. hypothetical reason. Clause types 4-7 are all based on verb + -nya constructions (see §3.2.3.6 and §3.8.4.2 (viii» which display nominal characteristics in some clauses.

Within a basic temporal framework of 'former' and 'latter' event with respect to the tense of the main clause these subordinate clauses can be classified as follows:

| former      | latter              |
|-------------|---------------------|
| causal      | purposive           |
| prior event | precautionary       |
|             | successive          |
|             | hypothetical reason |

'Simultaneous', as the label implies, has the same time reference as the main clause. The preponderance of 'latter event' subordinate clauses is interesting in view of the fact that Kuku Yalanji does not distinguish between present and future in its verbal tense inflections. A variety of subordinate clauses which clearly refer to a future event in the framework of discourse are an efficient means of filling this gap.

Subordinate clauses may or may not share common NPs with the main clause. Deletion possibilities of co-referential NPs in subordinate clauses are very free indeed, as long as the resulting sentence remains unambiguous. In the absence of strict syntactic rules that require or forbid NP deletion, any deleted NP in a subordinate clause is understood to be coreferential with the semantically and contextually most plausible NP in the main clause. If there is an ambiguity resulting from deletion, the preferred reading with regard to the coreferentiality of an omitted NP differs somewhat between the various types of subordinate clauses. Furthermore, not all subordinate clauses have the same range of possible coreferential NPS; for instance, the co-referentiality scope of a purposive construction is much larger than that of a hypothetical reason clause.

Some subordinate clauses may be interpreted as relative clauses, which will be discussed separately in §4.4.5.

### 4. 4.1 Purposive

A verb with purposive inflection -nkV (see §3.8.4.2 (v» may occur as the only verbal constituent of a main clause as well as in a subordinate clause. In a main clause a purposive verb implies the need or obligation to do something, arising out of a certain necessity, for example:

- (401) Ngayu mayi waju-nku. Dakuy. 1 sg.NOM(A) food.ABS(O) cook-PURP hungry 'I'd better cook some food. [I am] hungry. '
- (402) *Ngayku balji kadaba-ny*. *Ngayu balji* 1sg.POSS.ABS(S) bag.ABS(S) break-PAST 1sg.NOM(A) bag.ABS(O)

jirakal balka-nka. new.ABS(O) make-PURP 'My bag is broken. I have to make a new bag. '

A complex sentence with a purposive subordinate clause32 indicates that the action referred to in the main clause is performed so that the action described in the subordinate clause may take place, for instance 'X does Y in order to do Z'. In this function a purposive verb resembles a noun in dative case as 'goal of a purposeful action' (see §4.1 .4.4 (ii)). Purposive verbal inflection and dative nominal inflection are of course also very similar in form.33 Consider:

- (403) a. Yubal wuju mana milkul-ku. 2du.NOM(A) grass.ABS(O) get.IMP soup-DAT 'You two get some grass for the soup!' (i.e. for eating soup; this type of grass was made into a little brush to soak up and eat soup or honey with)
	- b. Yubal wuju mana, milkul nuka-nka. 2du.NOM(A) grass.ABS(O) get.IMP soup.ABS(O) eat-PURP 'You two get some grass for eating the soup!'

A dative noun in this environment indicates that its referent will be subjected to a contextually (and culturally) implicit action, like 'eating' in (403a). A purposive verb form, on the other hand, clearly identifies the type of action that is anticipated as in (403b).

A purposive clause may also imply a normal but unplanned consequence, which arises out of the main clause action, as for instance:

| (404) | Karrkay                                                                    | jurrki-ji-y,     | balka-ji-nka. |
|-------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|---------------|
|       | child.ABS(S)                                                               | move-REF-NONPAST | make-REF-PURP |
|       | 'The child moves and as a result gets born.' (i.e. moves down in the womb) |                  |               |

A purposive clause follows the main clause and virtually any co-referential NP may be deleted in the subordinate clause. Obligatory deletion applies to common S or A NPs, i.e. the grammatical subject, and a common 0 NP. Deletion of other co-referential NPs is preferred but will not apply where this renders the sentence ambiguous. Where this is the case, an anaphoric pronoun may be used.

Examples of deletion of NPs in the purposive clause which are co-referential with the S NP in the main clause:

<sup>32</sup> See R. Hershberger (1970:818-819).

<sup>33</sup> Verbal and nominal 'purposive' inflections resemble each other in form in many Australian languages; see Capell ( 1 956:77); Dixon (1 980:458).

S = S' <sup>34</sup>

Further examples are in (41 9) and (420).

Here the intransitive subject of the main clause is also understood to be the recipient of the food referred to in the subordinate clause.

Examples of deletion of NPs in the purposive clause which are co-referential with the A NP in the main clause:

A = A' (and O = O')

(409) Ngamu-ngku kuyu waju-l, nuka-nka. mother-ERG:pt(A) fish.ABS(O) cook-NONPAST eat-PURP 'Mother is cooking fish in order to eat [it].'

Deletion of the A NP in the purposive clause implies that it is mother who will eat the fish and not someone else.

Here the omitted object in the purposive clause could of course also refer to the noise produced by the hitting of the tree. For this reason it would be preferred to include the 0 NP

oblique object = s'

Another example is in (408).

oblique object = O' (and S = A')

(41 9) Nyulu bayan-ba jirakal-ba dunga-y, nuri-l-nuri-nka. 3sg.NOM(S) house-LOC new-LOC gO-NONPAST peep-l-REDUP-PURP 'He goes to the new house to have a peep [at it].'

oblique object = oblique object' (and S = A')

(420) N gayu maja-nda dunga-y, baba-ji-nka. I sg.NOM(S) bOSS-LOc:pt go-NONPAST ask-PURP 'I go to the boss to ask [him].'

It will have been noticed that all oblique objects in the examples are in locative case. Presumably there is no syntactic reason why the same deletion possibilities should not apply to oblique objects in other cases; however, it is very difficult to establish a semantically plausible environment in which other than locative oblique objects are co-referential with another NP (and 1 have not succeeded in doing so).

Of all the possibilities of co-referential NPs illustrated above some of course are more frequent than others, corresponding to the relative frequency of NPs in various functions. Co-referentiality of the S or A NP and of the 0 NP is the most frequent, while it is relatively uncommon for an oblique object to be co-referential with an NP in the same or a different function. The latter is in fact limited to verbs of utterance, for instance indirect speech as in (408), (4 1 7) and (4 1 8), the verb daji-l 'give', as in (408) and (4 1 2), and local expressions as in (41 6), (41 9) and (420).

It is not uncommon for both the A and 0 NP to be deleted in a purposive clause as for instance in (409). With such a large range of deletion possibilities certain ambiguities may arise. Consider the following sentences:

- (42 1) Kami-ngka karrkay wundi-l, wawurrwawurr-ma-nka. FFIMM-ERG:pt(A) child.ABS(O) take-NONPAST happy-INCHO-PURP 'Granny takes the child so that [he/she/it] be happy.'
- (422) Kami-ngka karrkay wundi-l, baya FF/MM-ERG:pt(A) child.ABS(O) take-NONPAST firewood.ABS(O) gather-PURP 'Granny takes the child to gather firewood.' muja-nka.

These sentences were considered somewhat ambiguous by informants in that it appeared unclear who would be happy and who would collect the firewood. However, preference was given to the interpretation in which it was "granny" in both cases, which is in keeping with the obligatory deletion of the co-referential S/A NP in the purposive clause. To make it clear that the child is meant to be the S or A NP of the purposive clause it is sufficient to include an anaphoric pronoun. For instance:

| (423) | Kami-ngka       | maral       | wundi-ny, | nyulu      | kambi          |
|-------|-----------------|-------------|-----------|------------|----------------|
|       | FF/MM-ERG:pt(A) | girl.ABS(O) | take-PAST | 3sg.NOM(A) | clothes.ABS(O) |
|       | nyungu          | mani-nka.   |           |            |                |
|       | 3sg.POSS.ABS(O) | get-PURP    |           |            |                |

'Granny took the girl so that she (the girl) will get her clothes. '

Nyulu in the purposive clause can only be co-referential with maral, the O NP of the main clause, because co-referential A = A' would require obligatory deletion of A'.

A purposive clause need not share a common NP with the main clause as for example:

(424) Ngayu baya waju-l, 1sg.NOM(A) fire.ABS(O) burn-NONPAST 2sg.NOM(S) warm-INCHO-PURP 'I light a fire so that you get warm.' yundu wumbul-ma-nka. 

(425) Dunyu-ngku kamukamu kari nuka-l, manyarr husband-ERG:pt(A) a1cohol.ABS(O) NEG drink-NONPAST wife.ABS(S) wawurrwawurr-ma-nka. happy-INCHO-PURP 

'The husband does not drink alcohol so that [his] wife is happy.'

Like nouns in dative case, the purposive fonn of the verb is also required in connection with an adjectival particle (see §3.9.1): 

- (426) a. Nyulu wawu minya-ka. 3sg.NOM(S) want meat-DAT 'He wants some meat.'
	- b. Nyulu wawu nuka-nka. 3sg.NOM(S) want eat-PURP 'He wants to eat.'
	- c. Nyulu wawu minya nuka-nka. 3sg.NOM(S) want meat.ABS(O) eat-PURP He wants to eat meat.
- (427) N gayu wawu jana 1sg.NOM(S) want 3pl.NOM(A) turtle.ABS(O) get-PURP 'I want them to get some turtle. ' ngawuya mani-nka.
- (428) a. Ngayu yinil wujurr-ku. ysg.NOM(S) afraid darkness-DAT 'I am afraid of the dark.'
	- b. Ngayu yinil wujurr-bu ysg.NOM(S) afraid darkness-LOC go-PURP 'I am afraid to go out in the dark.' dunga-nka.

Here the purposive clause is subordinate to a nominal sentence with which it may or may not share a common NP. 

Consider also: 

- (429) a. Yanya bana nuka-nka. this water drink-PURP 'This is drinking water/water for drinking.'
	- b. Yinya junjuyjunju:y waju-nku. that something/rubbish burn-PURP 'That is rubbish for burning.'

In these examples the purposive verb can probably be understood as an abbreviated subordinate clause in which a non-specific agent is implicit, i.e. 'water for someone to drink', 'rubbish for someone to burn'. The purposive verb is not part of the NP since case marking cannot be applied to both the noun and the verb form; the following sentence with locative inflection is ungrammatical.

(430) \*Bulbur bana-nga nuka-nka-rnun-bu dust water-LOC drink-PURP-mun-LOC 'There is dust in the drinking water.'

To express this idea the sentence would have to be paraphrased as something like:

(43 1) Yanya bana nuka-nka, yarnba bulbur bana-nga. this water drink-PURP but dust water-LOC 'This is drinking water, but there is dust in the water. '

# 4. 4.2 Precautionary

A precautionary verb form, stem + -nyji (see §3.8.4.2 (vi)), is used only in subordinate clauses. It conveys that the action referred to in the main clause is or should be performed in order to prevent the action or event described in the subordinate clause. This can be formalised as 'x does/does not do y lest z happen'.

A precautionary clause follows the main clause. Co-referential NP deletion possibilities are as extensive as those for purposive constructions; however, there is apparently no semantic environment in which an oblique object in the precautionary clause can be coreferential with an NP in the main clause. Again, obligatory deletion in the subordinate clause applies to co-referential S/A NPs, unless the main clause is an imperative as in (433), and to a common 0 NP. Other deletions are optional but preferred. Examples:

 $S = S'$ 

(432) Nyulu kari janji-l wawubaja-nga, bujil-janji-nyji. 3sg.NOM(S) NEG bathe-NONPAST river-LOC nose-bathe-PRECAUT 'He does not bathe in the river lest [he] drown.'

 $S = A'$ 

(433) Kari kalka-ji nguju-wuri-y, yundu ngawa kuni-nyji. NEG spear-COMIT funny-dance-IMP 2sg.NOM(A) baby.ABS(O) hit-PRECAUT 'Don't play/fool around with the spear lest you hit the baby!'

If a precautionary construction contains an imperative, which is often the case, the AlS NP is usually stated in the subordinate and not in the main clause, but it may be omitted altogether as in (436) and (44 1 ).

 $S = O'$ 

| (434) <i>Bama</i><br>Aborigine.ABS(S) | <i>kari jikan-ba</i><br>NEG grass-LOC | <i>kalbay-mba dunga-n-dunga-y,</i><br>long-LOC go-n-REDUP-NONPAST    |
|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <i>jarba-bu</i><br>snake-ERG(A)       | <i>bayka-nyji.</i><br>bite-PRECAUT    | 'Aborigines don't walk through long grass lest a snake bite [them].' |

### A=S'

(435) Warru-warru-ngku karnukarnu kari nuka-l-nuka-l, yg.man-REDUP-ERG:pt(A) a1cohol.ABS(O) NEG drink-l-REDUP-NONPAST kuni-wa-nyji. hit -RECIP-PRECA UT 'Young men don't drink alcohol lest [they] fight. '

 $A = A'$ 

(436) Mayi kari waju, buyun-dama-nyji. food.ABS(O) NEG cook.IMP bad-CAUS-PRECAUT 'Don't cook the food lest you spoil [it] !'

```
A=o' (ando=A')
```
(437) Kari kaya kuli-ji karrba, (yununy) bayka-nyji. NEG dog.ABS(O) wild-COMIT.ABS(O) touch.lMP 2sg.ACC(0) bite-PRECAUT 'Don't touch the vicious dog lest [it] bite [you]. '

In the last example it is perfectly clear who will do the biting and who will suffer it. It would therefore be safe to omit both the co-referential A and 0 NP in the subordinate clause. But consider:

(43 8) Babarr-angka karrkay-karrkay kanga-ny, nyunguny eZ-ERG:pt(A) child-REDUP.ABS(O) chase-PAST 3sg.ACC(0) kuni-nyji. Karrkay kuli-baka. hit-PRECAUT child(ren) wild-excess 'Elder sister chases the children away, lest they hit her. The children are a wild lot.'

Here, deletion of both co-referential NPs would result in some doubt as to who hit whom.

 $O = S'$ 

(439) Ngayu ngawa jarrakulba-l, banbadi-nyji. I sg.NOM(A) baby.ABS(O) carry-NONPAST cry.REDUP-PRECAUT 'I carry the baby lest [it] cry.'

 $O = A'$ 

(440) Bula jalbu-ngku dubu waJu-ny, kangkal 3du.NOM(A) woman-ERG:pt(A) ghOSt.ABS(O) burn-PAST own.childABS(O) ngaki-nyji-baja. steal-PRECA UT -again

'The two women burnt the ghost lest [he] steal [their] children again.'

Another example of  $O = A'$  is in (437).

 $O=O'$ 

(441) Kari diburr kulba, dara-y-mani-nyji. NEG egg.ABS(O) lift.IMP fall-y-CAUS-PRECAUT 'Don't pick up the egg lest you drop [it] !'

A subordinate NP that is co-referential with an oblique object in the main clause may be deleted, but retention in some form is preferred, for example:

| (442) | Nyulu      | wawu | kari | kaya-nda   | dunga-nka, |
|-------|------------|------|------|------------|------------|
|       | 3sg.NOM(S) | want | NEG  | dog-LOC:pt | go-PURP    |

(kaya-ngka) / (nyulu) bayka-nyji. dog-ERG:pt(A) / 3sg.NOM(A) bite-PRECAUT 'He doesn't want to go to the dog, lest (the dog)/(it) bite [him].'

Note that in (442) the precautionary clause is subordinated to a purposive clause.

A precautionary construction may also occur without a common NP, but this is not very frequent. For instance:

(443) Baya waju-l-waju, kiway kada-nyji. fire.ABS(O) burn-REDUP-IMP cold.ABS(S) come-PRECAUT 'Keep a fire burning lest it get cold!'

Occasionally, a precautionary clause may be uttered on its own. This is in the nature of a general warning where the addressee is supposed to know what to do to remedy the situation. If someone said:

(444) Yinya kuyu kabu-ma-nyji. that.ABS(S) fish.ABS(O) rotten-INCHO-PRECAUT 'That fish might get rotten. '

the addressee would infer that something ought to be done in order to preserve the fish.

As was mentioned in the previous section, the function of a purposive clause resembles that of a noun in dative case, i.e. 'goal of a purposeful action'. Similarly, in some contexts, the function of a precautionary clause may be compared to that of a dative noun expressing 'general threat for fear of which something is done or not done' (see §4.1 .4.4 (ii), examples (262) and (263)). Again, while the dative noun merely implies a threatening action by its referent, the precautionary clause spells out exactly what the danger is.

#### 4.4.3 Successive

The verb form root + -nyjiku (see §3.8.4.2 (vii)) in a subordinate clause indicates that this event follows closely after the event referred to in the main clause: 'X does Y shortly before Z happens'.35 The two events are seen in a temporal, and to some extent logical, but not a causal, relationship. It appears that the event in the subordinate clause can be regarded as a temporal reference point with respect to which the timing of the main clause is established. This interpretation is supported by the fact that the subordinate clause action may be unrealised, as in:

(445) Ngayu jinbal-da-ku jarba kuni-ny, nganya I sg.NOM(A) quick-INST-ADV snake.ABS(O) kill-PAST I sg.ACCCO) bayka-nyjiku. bite-sUCC 'I quickly killed the snake before [it] might bite me. '

Such a sentence would serve as an answer to the question 'when did you kill the snake?' (Snakes are normally expected to bite and this question would more likely to prompted by concern for the snake killer than by the desire to know whether it happened before or after

<sup>35</sup> R. Hershberger (1 979:76-77) uses the term "Prior Time Clause" for this type of subordinate clause. This is a misnomer since the subordinate clause actually refers to the following event and the main clause to the preceding one.

## 1 70 Chapter 4

breakfast.) On the other hand, a precautionary clause would be used, in my informant's words, "when a fellow ask you: 'What did you want to kill that snake for?'"

Co-referentiality in successive constructions appears to be restricted to core syntactic NPs. Of these, common NPs with the same grammatical function, i.e.  $A/S = A'/S'$  and  $O = O'$ , are obligatorily deleted in the subordinate clause. Examples:

 $S=S'$ 

(446) N gayu wunana-ny, jilba-dunga-nyjiku. I sg.NOM(S) lie.REDUP-PAST walk-go-succ 'I had a rest before going for a walk.'

 $S=A'$ 

(447) lalbu mara julurri-ji-y, mayi woman.ABS(S) hand.ABS(S) wash-REF-NONPAST food.ABS(O) damba dingka-nyjiku. damper.ABS(O) knead-SUCC 'The woman washes [her] hands before kneading damper.'

#### $A=S'$

(448) *Maral-angka kambi bangka-l, dunyu-ndu* girl-ERG:pt(A) clothes.ABS(O) stock.up-NONPAST husband-LOC:pt lie-SUCC 'The girl stocks up clothes before getting married.' wuna-nyjiku.

 $A=A'$ 

(449) Nyulu bubu kida-l-kida-l, bayan 3sg.NOM(A) ground.ABS(O) scrape-l-REDUP-NONPAST camp.ABS(O) ngara-nyjiku. set.up-SUcc 'She sweeps the ground before setting up camp.'

 $O= O'$  (and  $A = A'$ )

(450) lalbu-jalbu-ngku marra dinda-l, duda-nyjiku. woman-REDUP-ERG:pt(A) zamia.nut.ABS(O) roast-NONPAST pound-SUCC 'The women roast the zamia nuts before pounding them.'

Note that successive subordinate constructions with common 0 NP but different A NP are not favoured, although possible. Sentence (450) with different agents would rather be rendered as:

(45 1) lalbujalbungku marra dindal, maral-maral-angka marra girl-REDUP-ERG:pt(A) zamia.nut.ABS(O)

duda-l-da.

pound-NONPASf-TEMPl

'The women roast the zamia nuts, then the girls pound the nuts.'

where *marra* can be optionally deleted in the second clause.

Successive constructions may of course have co-referential NPs in different functions, but deletion is not liked in these cases. Pronoun reduction is much preferred, even if the sentence is quite unambiguous, as for instance in (445) where  $A = O'$  and  $O = A'$ . Examples of  $O = A'$  or  $S'$  are:
