The root ngadi(y)- <sup>7</sup>occurs only in inflected form, ngadi(y)-ngka(DAT) 'for a long time' and ngadi(y)-muny (ABL)’ from way back’, or with clitic -ku, i.e. ngadi(y)-ku ‘a long time ago'. (Clitic -ku might have perfective implication with time words, e.g. yilayku 'yesterday'.) The form yilay which occurs in three time words is another possible, but not analysable, root that cannot occur in isolation.

Time words in simple root form without inflection refer to 'in, at, during a given time', which is similar to the locative implication of uninflected location words, for example:

- ( 1 1 3) Yilayku nyulu bambay-ma-ny. yesterday 3sg.NOM(S) sick-INCHO-PAST 'He became ill yesterday. '
- ( 1 1 4) Wunkuny nyulu dunga-y doctor tomorrow 3sg.NOM(A) go-NONPAST doctor.ABS(O) see-PURP 'Tomorrow he will go to see the doctor.' nyaji-nka.

Apart from the root form, time words may occur in dative and ablative case, taking regular 'neutral' inflections. Dative implies 'for a given time' and ablative 'since, from a given time', for example:

| (115)                                  | Ngayu      | mayi        | kanbal      | kuji-l       | yilaybaja-ka |
|----------------------------------------|------------|-------------|-------------|--------------|--------------|
|                                        | 1sg.NOM(A) | food.ABS(O) | some.ABS(O) | keep-NONPAST | later-DAT    |
| 'I keep some food for later on today.' |            |             |             |              |              |

( 1 1 6) Nyulu kambi mukul kuji-l-kuji-ny ngadi-muny. 3sg.NOM(A) clothes.ABS(O) old.ABS(O) keep-l-REDUP-PAST long.time-ABL 'He has been keeping some old clothes from a long time [ago].'

Juma 'soon' has two alternative forms in dative case which are used in free variation. These arejuma-ka andjumay-ngka, which may indicate that there is a suppletive or archaic rootjumay, for example:

(1 1 7) Nyulu kulji mani-ny, yijarri-ny jumay-ngkal-ka. 3sg.NOM(A) rock.ABS(O) get-PAST put-PAST nexttime-DAT 'He got a rock and set it up for the next time. ' (text 1 2, line 60)

Other time stretches are referred to by common nouns or stems that take regular nominal inflections, for example:

| wujurr          | 'night, darkness'                  |
|-----------------|------------------------------------|
| wujurr-bu (LOC) | 'at, during the night'8            |
| warngku         | 'one day and night' ('sleep')      |
| kija            | 'moon, month'                      |
| bulur-iji       | 'cold season' ('dew/chill -COMIT') |
| wungar-iji      | 'hot season' ('sun-COMIT')         |

<sup>1</sup> We can assume that this root has final -y, which is deleted after vowel *i*- (see §2.5.2), since it takes the dative allomorph for y-final roots. However, because this root never occurs in uninflected form, I do not represent root-final y in further examples.

<sup>8</sup> The beginning of the Christmas carol Silent Night has been translated as wujurrbu ngadiku ‘during the night a long time ago'.

### 72 Chapter 3

Times of the day may be referred to by descriptive phrases, e.g. wungar dakal 'sunrise' ('sun climb'), wungar wangkarwangkar 'mid-morning to early afternoon' ('sun above').

#### 3.5 Personal pronouns

Kuku Yalanji has free pronoun forms which are used in reference to animate beings, particularly humans. Personal pronouns distinguish three numbers - singular, dual and plural - as well as inclusive and exclusive for first person non-singular. However, the distinction between inclusive and exclusive, particularly in the dual, is not always made. Where this is the case, the exclusive form is used rather than the inclusive form. Thus it appears that the exclusive forms are taking on an unmarked meaning, and inclusive forms may become obsolete.9

Second person plural is used as an honorific address term towards some in-law relations, particularly brother-in-law.

#### 3.5. 1 Paradigm

Core-syntactic case marking for personal pronouns follows a nominative/accusative pattern with an unmarked form for both transitive and intransitive subject (nominative) and a marked form for transitive object (accusative). This is of course different from nominal syntactic case marking where intransitive subject and transitive object take zero inflection and only the transitive subject has a marked form. Except for this difference in the core-syntactic case-marking system, which is widespread in Australian languages, pronouns are used in all cases that have a 'potent' inflectional allomorph, i.e. dative, general locative and ablative.

Semantic constraints do not allow pronouns to occur in instrumental or perlative case. Instrumental inherently implies inanimacy, which is in contrast to the animate reference of pronouns. R. Hershberger ( 1 964c:60) attested instrumental pronoun forms based on the possessive stem as in the following example (quoted from Hershberger):

(1 1 8) Ngayu jana-nda-mundu Carol kunin. 1sg.NOM(A) 3pl-POSS-INST Carol.ABS(O) hit-PAST 'I hit Carol with them'

Such sentences were rejected by my informants, who replaced the pronoun with a demonstrative which can have either animate or inanimate reference. Similarly, perlative is not used with pronouns since animate beings are not regarded as something that can be 'passed through'. Construed sentences like 'the spear went right through him' proved unacceptable and were rendered as 'the spear got stuck in him'. Abessive pronoun forms were rejected by informants in favour of ablative forms.

<sup>9</sup> Djabugay does not distinguish between inclusive and exclusive, nor are there dual forms in Djabugay. The first person plural form, cognate with the Kuku Yalanji exclusive form, is: nganyji (nominative), nganyjiny (accusative) (Hale 1 976b:237; Patz 1 99 1 :274).

A full paradigm of inflected pronoun forms and comitative and possessive sterns with zero inflection is given in Table 3.6. This paradigm can be analysed as follows. For nonsingular pronouns the nominative form serves as root for all other cases. The accusative suffix is:

| -ngan / V-<br>-an / C-  | in Yalanji dialect  |
|-------------------------|---------------------|
| -niny / V-<br>-iny / C- | in Nyungkul dialect |

Other suffixes follow the nominal case inflection paradigm. Note that the possessive suffix does not show a dialect difference between Yalanji and Nyungkul as it does with nouns. The Nyungkul nominal possessive suffix -(*V*)*ngV* is used for non-singular possessive pronouns in both Yalanji and Nyungkul.

For second and third person singular there are two distinct forms for nominative and for possessive with the possessive form serving as base for the other cases. The accusative suffix IS:

| -ny   | in Yalanji                                       |
|-------|--------------------------------------------------|
| -niny | in Nyungkul (the same as for non-singular forms) |

First person singular shows three distinct forms, which are the same in both dialects:

| nominative: | ngayu  |
|-------------|--------|
| accusative: | nganya |
| possessive: | ngayku |

The possessive form is used as base for all other case inflections.

To summarise, we can say that there is a two-way split in the Kuku Yalanji pronoun paradigm according to base forms. For non-singular pronouns the nominative form serves as base throughout the paradigm. Singular pronouns have distinct forms for nominative and possessive with all other cases being built on the possessive form; only first person singular has a suppletive form for accusative. Table 3.7 shows pronominal base forms and their suffixes.

## 3.5.2 Possessive stems

Where a possessive pronoun modifies a noun as part of a wider noun phrase, the pronoun normally agrees in case with the head noun, but does not necessarily have to do so: an uninflected possessive stern may be used. If the head noun is in absolutive case, the accompanying possessive pronoun also remains uninflected, for example:

| (119) | Ngayu                      | nyungu          | yaba      | nyaji-ny. |
|-------|----------------------------|-----------------|-----------|-----------|
|       | 1sg.NOM(A)                 | 3sg.POSS.ABS(O) | eB.ABS(O) | see-PAST  |
|       | 'I saw his elder brother.' |                 |           |           |

(120) *Ngayku kaya-ngka* 1sg.POSS dog-ERG:pt(A) child.ABS(O) bite-PAST 'My dog bit a child. ' karrkay bayka-ny.

# Table 3.7: Personal pronoun base forms and inflections

\* This and the following inflections have allomorphs with initial vowel following root-final consonants (see nominal case inflections, Table 3.1). Any vowel V is determined by vowel harmony rule (see §2.5.1).

### 76 Chapter 3

If the possessive pronoun is inflected in agreement with the head noun, a special possessive pronoun stem has to be formed which takes suffixes from the 'neutral' set of case inflections. (Nominal possessive stems inflect in the same way, see §3.2.3.2.) Again, the formation of these stems is different for singular and non-singular forms:

> singular pronoun: possessive root + non-singular pronoun: nominative root + -ndVmun/V--wun- ,.., -ngun- -VndVmun/C-

This shows that non-singular pronouns form possessive sterns in the same way as nouns (see §3.2.3.2). A full paradigm of possessive pronoun stems is given in Table 3.8, followed by some examples in sentences.

# Table 3.8: Possessive pronoun stems with non-zero inflection

\*The stem-forming suffix for singular pronouns has also been recorded as -ngun. The two forms occur in free variation.

- (121) Ngayku-wun-du kaya-ngka karrkay bayka-ny. 1sg-POSS-ERG(A) dog-ERG:pt(A) child.ABS(O) bite-PAST 'My dog bit a child. ' cf. ( 1 20)
- ( 1 22) Ngayu wawu jirray yunu-wun-ku ngamu-nku. Isg.NOM(S) like much 2sg-POSS-DAT mother-DAT:pt 'I like your mother very much.'
- ( 1 23) Yanya mani daya yubal-andamun-bu nganjan-anda. this.ABs(o) money.ABS(O) give.lMP 2du-POSS-LOC father-Loc:pt 'Give this money to your [dual] father!'
- ( 1 24) Buliman kada-y jana-ndamun-muny bayan-muny. police.ABS(S) come-NONPAST 3pl-POSS-ABL house-ABL 'A policeman is coming from their house.'

Like nouns, pronouns do not have special forms to indicate 'possessor of a possessor'. The regular possessive stem is used and there is a preference for locative inflection, regardless of the case of head noun, for example:

(1 25) Nyulu yunu-wun-bulyunu 3sg.NOM(A) 2sg-POSS-LOcJ2sg.POSS.ABS(O)

> kangkal-ba mayi wundi-ny. own.child-POSS.ABS(O) food.ABS(O) take-PAST 'He took your child's food. '

(126) N gayku-wun-bul -du babarr-andamun-du kaya-ngka I sg.POSS-LOO-ERG(A) eZ-POSS-ERG(A) dog-ERG:pt(A) ngayku minya ngaki-ny. I sg.POSS.ABS(O) meat.ABS(O) steal-PAST 'My elder sister's dog stole my meat.'

(It must be pointed out that such constructions were only obtained through elicitation.)

### 3.5.3 Historical notes

From the historical point of view the system and forms of Kuku Yalanji personal pronouns are quite conservative. It may be assumed that pA pronouns had singular/ dual/plural distinction and the eastern languages generally show relatively few changes in this system. As for the actual roots, similar forms can be found in many other Australian languages and Kuku Yalanji personal pronoun roots have undergone sound changes and reinterpretations that are quite common.

Dixon (1980:339-346) has reconstructed monosyllabic roots for singular pronouns in S-function with inflections for A and 0 function:

|     | S    | A          | O          |
|-----|------|------------|------------|
| 1sg | ngay | ngay + DHu | ngay + NHa |
| 2sg | ngin | ngin + du  | ngin + NH  |
| 3sg | NHu  | NHu + lu   | NHu + NHa  |

As a general trend Australian languages at some stage in their development began to abolish monosyllabic roots and in most languages, Kuku Yalanji among them, the pA agentive forms were reinterpreted as roots covering both A and S function. Following common phonological changes (outlined in Dixon 1 980) this yielded in Kuku Yalanji:

| 1sg | ngayu        |
|-----|--------------|
| 2sg | yundu        |
| 3sg | nyulu (yulu) |

The suppletive first person singular accusative form nganya can be analysed as directly related to the pA 0 form ngay-NHa, and the first person singular possessive root ngayku is indeed identical with the corresponding pA form ngay-ku if the assumption holds true that -ku is the pA genitive suffix. (However, Kuku Yalanji cannot provide any more evidence for GEN -ku than, for instance, Warrgamay, which also has I sg POSS ngayku, but does not use GEN -ku anywhere else in its pronoun paradigm.)

Proto Australian non-singular forms are thought to have had one root for S/A function with suffix -NHa for 0 function. The assumed pA forms are (Dixon 1 980:334-339):

r

| 1du | ngali      |
|-----|------------|
| 2du | NHu(m)balV |
| 3du | bula       |
| 1pl | ngana      |
| 2pl | NHurra     |
| 3pl | DHaNa      |

The distinction between inclusive/exclusive first person forms appears to be an innovation. Distribution in modern languages shows that where this distinction is made ngali and ngana usually indicate 'inclusive', while 'exclusive' forms are either based on *ngali* and *ngana* or are quite unrelated to these. In Kuku Yalanji the reverse applies for first person dual forms: ngali implies 'exclusive', while the 'inclusive' pronoun involves an increment to this form: ngalim!.. First person plural pronouns, on the other hand, concur with the general Australian pattern in that ngana is the 'inclusive' form. Nganjin 'lpl exc.' could be based on ngana (cf. Guugu Yirnidhirr inland dialect nganhdhaan ' lpl'), but there is no real evidence to show that it is.

The second person non-singular forms yubal and yurra have developed by lenition of the initial consonant: NH > ny > y. (Similar lenition of the first consonant has also applied to second and third person singular.) The final vowel of 2du \*NHu(m)baIV has been dropped in Kuku Yalanji. The fact that inflections to yubal involve an initial vowel, e.g. Dative yubal-anka in contrast to ngana-nka, is probably of no consequence since all 'potent' inflections in Kuku Yalanji have allomorphs with initial vowel following root-final consonants.

Third person plural *jana* shows a regular reflex of pA *DH* (*DHaNa* > *jana*), while third person dual bula involves no change at all.

### 3.6 Interrogative pronouns

# 3.6.1 Paradigm and morphology

Interrogative pronoun roots in Kuku Yalanji show the common Australian distinction between 'who', 'what' and 'where'. In many Australian languages interrogative pronouns can have both interrogative and indefinite meaning, e.g. 'who/someone'. This is not so for Kuku Yalanji interrogative forms 'who' and 'what', which have only interrogative sense. 'Where', on the other hand, may imply both 'where' and 'somewhere'. To express 'something indefinite' the generic term junjuy is used in reference to anything inanimate or animate except humans, but there seems to be no way to express 'some indefinite person'. (In precontact times the generic term bama 'Aboriginal person' would presumably have been sufficient for this function.)

|         | Yalanji | Nyungkul |
|---------|---------|----------|
| 'who'   | wanya   | wanju    |

The form for 'who' differs in the Yalanji and Nyungkul dialects but 'what' and 'where' are the same (see Table 3 .9). 'Who' and 'what' inflect according to the nominal system of case marking; that is, core syntactic inflections distinguish between transitive subject and intransitive subject/transitive object. (This is different from the most frequent pattern in Australian languages where 'who' inflects in a nominative/accusative pattern like pronouns, and 'what' like nominals in an ergative/absolutive pattern.) 'Who' takes suffixes from the 'potent' set of case inflections, and 'what' takes inflections from the 'neutral' set. 'Where' is used only in local cases; it is also the base for further interrogatives like 'when' and 'how'.

A paradigm of inflected 'who' and 'what' forms and their possessive and comitative stems is given in Table 3 . 1 0. The Yalanji form wanya 'who' shows regular nominal suffixes for all but the possessive stem with zero inflection. This stem, in both Yalanji and Nyungkul, takes a suffix identical to the 'neutral' locative inflection which is also used for possessive with a subset of kinship terms (see §3.2.4). The Nyungkul form wanju 'who' also takes regular nominal suffixes; however, on the evidence from all inflected forms except ergative we have to recognise an underlying root with final *y*, namely *wanjuy*. This root takes the regular suffixes with initial vowel that follow a root-final consonant.

Table 3.10: Paradigm of interrogative pronouns 'who' and 'what'

Wanyu 'what' shows an underlying stem wa nyu rri(y )- for all but absolutive case, followed by regular case inflections from the 'neutral' set. For ergative/instrumental an alternative form *wanyurri-mun-du* may be used. Speakers who use this latter form seem to have reinterpreted the stem as ending in i and add the catalytic suffix -mun- onto the trisyllabic

<sup>11</sup> Comitative stems with non-zero inflections beginning with nasal *m* or a stop take the comitative allomorph -jirr (see Table 3.3).

<sup>10</sup> These forms are not favoured for the local sense of ablative. Preference is given to *wanjamuny* 'where from'.

root. Speakers' intuitions about the inflected forms of wanyu appear to be uncertain in another respect as well. Note that vowel harmony does not match the suffix vowel with the final stem vowel, e.g. \*wanyurri.(y)njQ, but with the final vowel of the uninflected root, e.g. wanyurri(y)nju. This might suggest that the whole of -*rri*(*y*) + inflection is in fact interpreted as the suffix.

The morpheme -*rri*(*y*)- may have been a stem-forming suffix at some stage. It also seems to be present in wanjarrinya 'how many' (see below), in the plural demonstrative forms in Kuku Yalanji and Guugu Yimidhirr, e.g. yinyarriny 'those people' (see §3.7), and in Yidiny yinga-rriny 'this kind' and wanyja-rriny 'what kind', where this morpheme cannot be analysed either (see Dixon 1 977:1 97-1 98).

Wanyu has no possessive forms, since inanimate things are considered incapable of owning anything. The local term wanjamuny 'where from' is used to express 'what does that belong to'.

The dative form of 'what', wanyurringku,12 is used in the sense of 'why' (lit. for what [purpose]). However, if the question contains a reference to a location, e.g. 'why did you go there', the locative form of wanyu may be used, although the dative form is possible, for example:

| (127) a. | Wanyurrimbu | yundu      | kaya       | wundi-ny  | bayan-ba?                                                           |

|          |             |            |            |           | 'Why did you take the dog into the house?' (and not somewhere else) |

The locative and dative forms of wanyu imply a different focus of the question. The locative form enquires after the reason for a particular choice of location as in (1 27a): 'why the house and not some other place?'. The dative form, on the other hand, asks for the reason that prompted a particular action as indicated by the translation for ( l 27b).

A specific use of the comitative form has to be noted: it is always used when enquiring about the nature of an illness, for example:

(1 28) Yundu wanyurrinji bambay? 2sg:NOM(S) what.COMIT sick 'What are you ill with?'

A commonly used prompt for further information in a conversation involves wanyu and suffix -baja 'again, Degree' (see §3.2.3.8 (ii) and §3.10.3): wanyubaja 'what else'.

Wanja 'where, somewhere' can be classed among the location words and as such implies general locative by its uninflected root and takes only local cases (cf. location words §3.3 .2). But it seems that the uninflected form is being replaced by another form: wanjabu. H. Hershberger and R. Hershberger (pers. comm.) reported that several years ago forms wanja and wanjabu were used in free variation. But it appeared that wanja was the more general term implying 'where at/where to' while wanjabu asked more specifically for location

<sup>12</sup> Stem-final *y*, which conditions the inflectional form but is lost after *i*- (see §2.5.2), will not be. represented in further examples.
