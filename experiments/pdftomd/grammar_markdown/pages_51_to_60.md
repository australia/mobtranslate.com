According to rule (i), vowels /a/ and /u/ have a palatal offglide if they precede a palatal nasal or stop, for example:

| nukainy   | 'ate'           |
|-----------|-----------------|
| jalbainy  | 'taboo food'    |
| wunkuiny  | 'next day'      |
| jukumuiny | 'from the tree' |
| waijul    | 'burn, cook'    |
| nguijan   | 'jealous'       |

Generally, palatalisation is stronger with vowel /a/ than with vowel /u/.

Rule (ii) determines that apical nasal /n/ is palatalised before palatal stop /j/, for example:

| Yalanjji  | '(language name)' |
|-----------|-------------------|
| baykanjji | 'lest (it) bite'. |

This rule would seem to negate the phonemic distinction between clusters /nj/ and /nyj/ in Kuku Yalanji. However, assimilation rule (i) helps to show the difference between the two clusters. A palatalised nasal before /j/ does not in turn influence its preceding vowel, whereas a phonemic palatal nasal does; that is, assimilation rule (i) precedes assimilation rule (ii). Consider the following minimal pairs:

| binainyji   | 'fig-like fruit'  |
|-------------|-------------------|
| binanj-ji   | 'with a rudder'   |
| jalbanj-ji  | 'with a tree top' |
| jalbainy-ji | 'with taboo food' |

According to assimilation rule (iii), velar stop /k/ is labialised before round vowel /u/, as for instance in:

| <i>dakwuy</i> | 'hungry'      |
|---------------|---------------|
| <i>nyikwu</i> | 'now, today'. |

This rule shows greatest variation between speakers, some of them clearly labialising the velar stop and others not at all.

#### 2.5 Morphophonological processes

# 2.5. 1 Vowel harmony

For a number of suffixes in Kuku Yalanji the suffix vowel is selected according to vowelharmony rules relating to the last root- or stem-vowel. The affected suffixes are: all allomorphs of nominal inflections ergative, dative, locative, and perlative (with two notable exceptions to be discussed below), verbal subordination suffix -nyV and 'first of all' clitic -ngVrr. For these suffixes the following vowel harmony rules apply:

$$\begin{array}{rcl} \text{suffix vowel} = & u & / & u(\mathbf{C}) \text{-} \\ & a & / & \left\{ \begin{array}{c} a(\mathbf{C}) \\ i(\mathbf{C}) \end{array} \right\} \end{array}$$

#### 32 Chapter 2

In the case of u/u- and a/a- there is clearly total assimilation to the preceding vowel; however, this does not apply where the last stem vowel is /i/.

Data from Wagaman (Dixon, fieldnotes; see also Dixon 1 980:178- 1 79), an inland dialect of the same language as Kuku Yalanji, may give some indication on how this partial vowel harmony developed. Table 2.7 shows the vowel distribution in ergative, dative and locative inflections in Wagaman.

|          | <i>a-</i>                                                        | <i>u-</i>                                        | <i>i-</i>          |
|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| Ergative | - $\eta$ <i>ga</i><br>(one occurrence<br>of - $\eta$ <i>gu</i> ) | - $\eta$ <i>gu</i>                               | - $\eta$ <i>gu</i> |
| Dative   | - <i>ga</i> (sometimes - <i>gu</i> )                             | - <i>gu</i>                                      | - <i>gu</i>        |
| Locative | - $\eta$ <i>a</i>                                                | - $\eta$ <i>u</i> (sometimes - $\eta$ <i>a</i> ) | - $\eta$ <i>a</i>  |

Table 2.7: Vowel harmony in Wagaman inflections

It appears that these case inflections in Wagaman have the underlying forms: ERG - $ŋ$ gu, DAT -gu, LOC -lJa, which correspond to case inflections in languages that have no vowel alteration. Then the following vowel-harmony rule applies:

| suffix vowel | $u \rightarrow a/a(C)-$ |
|--------------|-------------------------|
| suffix vowel | $a \rightarrow u/u(C)-$ |

but after final stem vowel /i/ - the suffix vowel remains unchanged.

It seems that in Kuku Yalanji the harmony pattern for the underlying *a*-final locative suffix has been generalised to apply to *u*-final suffixes such as ergative and dative as well, and has then also spread to other suffixes. For dative and locative the vowel-harmony rules apply totally and no underlying canonical forms -ku DAT or -nga LOC can be determined. Ergative and perlative, on the other hand, each have one allomorph which is never affected by vowel harmony. This is neutral ergative -*bu/V* and perlative -*burr/V* which could be regarded as the canonical forms. (Note the typical vowel luI in the ergative inflection.)

It seems reasonable to assume that Kuku Yalanji vowel harmony has developed from the harmony rules that apply in Wagaman, since the present Kuku Yalanji system is more comprehensive and general than the Wagaman rules. The generalisation of the harmony pattern for locative inflection (as in Wagaman) could be explained in the following way. Locative in Kuku Yalanji has a large variety of functions (see §4. 1 .4.4 (iii)), including some references to goal, which in other languages is expressed by dative. Locative therefore has a higher occurrence rate than dative in Kuku Yalanji. If we look at the relative distribution of locative and ergative in discourse, we find that an agent NP is very often a pronoun, where ergative does not apply. Locative inflection, on the other hand, is the same for nouns and pronouns, so that again locative inflections have a relatively higher occurrence rate than ergative inflections. Thus it would appear that Kuku Yalanji vowel harmony has been generalised following the pattern of the most frequently occurring inflection. Furthermore, the fact that the last root vowel is much more often /a/ than /u/ or /i/ (see [§2.2.2, Table 2.3](#)) could have influenced the vowel-harmony rule in Kuku Yalanji. If the Wagaman system applied at some stage in Kuku Yalanji, inflectional suffixes would have contained vowel lal much more frequently than /u/ or /i/. Again, the most common form could then have been

generalised to apply also after root vowel /i/, which occurs least frequently, whereas root vowel /u/ maintained its influence on the following suffix vowel. This also corresponds to the pattern of vowel association that is found within roots, i.e. that /a/ is followed more often by  $/a/$  than by any other vowel and  $/i/$  has at least some positive association with  $/a/$ , whereas  $/u/$  has a strong tendency to be followed by  $/u/$  (see §2.2.2, Tables 2.4 and 2.5).

## 2.5.2 Deletion of semivowel /y/

After vowel  $/i/$  in word-final position or before another consonant, semivowel  $/y/$  is not pronounced. Thus we have the rule:

$$\mathbf{y} \stackrel{\ast}{\to} \mathfrak{g} \quad \prime \stackrel{\ast}{\to} \mathbf{y} \quad \prime \begin{Bmatrix} \mathfrak{g} \\ \mathbf{C} \end{Bmatrix}$$

Because of this deletion rule, roots ending in -iy cannot be distinguished from those ending in -i in citation form, but they are distinct in some inflected forms. The neutral locative inflection, for instance, is -ng $V/V$ - and -mb $V/y$ - (with different allomorphs after other consonants). Consider the following roots in citation form (absolutive) and with locative inflection:

| Absolutive: | kulji     | 'stone'                   |
|-------------|-----------|---------------------------|
|             | dili      | 'corkwood pine'           |
|             | duli      | 'burnt grass'             |
| Locative:   | kulji-nga | 'on/to the stone'         |
|             | dili-mba  | 'on/to the corkwood pine' |
|             | duli-mba  | 'on/to the burnt grass'   |

From the inflections we can infer that *dili* and *duli* have underlying forms with final  $/y/$ , *diliy, duliy*, whereas *kulji* is a genuinely *i*- final root. These examples also illustrate the loss of  $/y/$  after  $/i/$  before a following consonant. Within a root,  $/y/$  cannot be recovered in this environment, but the surprisingly low occurrence rate of  $/iy/$  in medial position (see §2.2.2) may indicate that some instances of underlying Iyl have been lost.

In order to indicate which inflectional allomorph is used with a particular nominal root, I represent such roots in citation form with final -i or -iy respectively. (Here I differ from the Hershberger spelling system which does not represent final y after *i*-.)

Similarly, verbal nonpast inflection -*y* is not pronounced after roots or stems ending in -*i*. However, rather than introducing an additional nonpast inflectional allomorph of - $\phi$  / *i*-, I represent all *y*-conjugation verbs with final -*y* in nonpast tense and in citation form (-*y* is also the conjugation marker), for example:

citation forrnlnonpast:

| badiy      | 'cry, weep' | pronounced: | badi      |
|------------|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| karangajiy | 'sneak up'  |             | karangaji |
| manijiy    | 'get (itr)' |             | maniji    |

analogous to: bunday 'sit' janay 'stand'

# 2.5.3 Syllable reduction

The following three syllable reductions have been observed in normal speech:

(i) Locative inflection -*nga* after root-final /*a*/ is reduced to root-final long vowel *a*:, that IS:

Locative -anga � a:

as for instance bana: 'inlto the water' instead of bananga. The reduction of locative inflection to long vowel *a*: has not been heard more than perhaps half a dozen times in narratives and has always been corrected to -*nga* by the informant when playing back the tape. But even if it is used only occasionally and is not accepted as an alternative to the full inflection, this reduced form is very interesting when considering Djabugay. In Djabugay the locative inflection for roots ending in a vowel is lengthening of the final vowel (Patz 1 99 1 :264) and the same applies for Yidiny on even-syllabled stems (Dixon 1 977: 1 28). This supports the previous suggestion (see §2.1.1) that Kuku Yalanji is the more conservative and Dyabugay the more innovative of the two languages.

- (ii) The causative verb-forming derivation -bungal is frequently reduced to -bal, particularly in reduplicated forms, e.g. kima-bungal or kima-bal 'make something soft', dandi-bungal-bungal or dandi-bal-bal 'keep making something hard'. Here, not all speakers correct themselves when they have used the reduced form, maintaining that either form is fine. It appears that the reduced form -bal may be in the process of becoming the accepted norm.
- (iii) In some reduplicated verbs a reduced form is already firmly established as the norm. Usually, verb roots reduplicate as a whole, but six very commonly used verbs show only partial reduplication of either the first or the second syllable and these forms are always used instead of the wholly reduplicated forms which by now are even unacceptable. These verbs are:

Reduplication of first syllable:

| banbadiy                          | *badi-n-bady    | 'keep crying'        |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| janjanay                          | *jana-n-janay   | 'keep standing'      |
| kankaday                          | *kada-n-kaday   | 'keep coming'        |
| wanarriy                          | ?warri-n-warriy | 'keep running'       |
| Reduplication of second syllable: |                 |                      |
| bundanday                         | *bunda-n-bunday | 'keep sitting, stay' |
| wunanay                           | *wuna-n-wunay   | 'keep lying, sleep'  |

(For a full discussion of form and function of verb reduplication see §3.8.S.S (ii).)

Another partially reduplicated verb form that is used occasionally is *nukalkal* instead of nuka-I-nuka-l 'keep eating'. Again, only the second syllable is reduplicated in the reduced

form. So there are four examples of first-syllable reduplication and three examples of second-syllable reduplication, and the question arises why it should sometimes be only the first and sometimes only the second syllable that is reduplicated. Second-syllable reduplicated forms share the common aspect that the syllable containing the most frequent vowel /*a*/ is reduplicated and the syllable containing a less frequent vowel is dropped. The same pattern is evident in the reduction of -*bungal* to -*bal*, and also in the forms *banbadiy* and wanarriy with first-syllable reduplication. One could therefore make the tentative suggestion that in a reduction process the syllable with the less frequent vowels /u/ and /i/ is deleted and the syllable containing the most frequent vowel /a/ is maintained.

# 2.6 Stress and intonation

Stress, which is characterised by higher pitch and loudness (see Ladefoged 1 975:222ff.), identifies a word as a unit in Kuku Yalanji. Clausal intonation contours, the highest point of which is the clause stress, show some variation and are the only distinguishing feature for certain types of clauses. H. Hershberger and E.v. Pike (1 970) have done a detailed study of stress and intonation in Kuku Yalanji. Unless stated otherwise, my own findings concur with Hershberger and Pike, but I have generalised some of their rules and addressed some further aspects.

## 2.6. 1 Word stress

Every word in Kuku Yalanji has primary stress on the first syllable, after which there is a distinct drop in pitch for disyllabic words and a more gradual drop for words of more than two syllables (see Hershberger & Pike 1970:791-792). Words with four or more syllables that are roots, reduplicated forms, or compounds, may have secondary stress on the third syllable, that is the first syllable of the second root in reduplicated forms of compounds. A reduplicated trisyllabic root may have secondary stress on the fourth syllable, again the first syllable of the second root. (There are apparently no compounds where the first constituent has more than two syllables.) Thus we can set up the general word stress rule:

 $V \rightarrow + \text{stress} / # \text{root} [C (VC\_1VC\_1)] -$ 

where C1 may be a single consonant or a cluster. For example: (`primary stress, `secondary stress)

| jálbu           | 'woman'                       |
|-----------------|-------------------------------|
| bájibay         | 'bone'                        |
| wáwubàja        | 'river'                       |
| yálmburràjaka   | 'whale'                       |
| kángkal-kàngkal | 'own children'                |
| mílka-wùlay     | 'forget' (lit. ear-die)       |
| míyil-dùdu      | 'illiterate' (lit. eye-blunt) |
| búlkiji-bùlkiji | 'pipis'                       |

### 36 Chapter 2

However, secondary stress is not obligatory and is usually omitted in other than careful citation forms, leaving the word with stress only on the first syllable.

Derived stems (other than compounds or reduplicated forms) and inflected forms with or without clitics, for which no detailed stress patterns are indicated by Hershberger and Pike, receive secondary stress as follows:

(i) Disyllabic inflections or derivational suffixes are treated like roots and may have secondary word stress on the first syllable, for example:

| <i>máral-àngka</i>   | 'girl -ERG:pt'   |
|----------------------|------------------|
| <i>ngánjan-ànda</i>  | 'father -LOC:pt' |
| <i>bímakay-kàrra</i> | 'FZ-KPL'         |

(ii) Monosyllabic inflections, derivational suffixes or clitics are unstressed. But if the resulting word has more than three syllables, the penultimate syllable receives secondary stress, unless it is the last root syllable, in which case it remains unstressed, for example:

| báma-ngka                | 'Aborigine-ERG:pt'             |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------|
| báma-ngkà-ku             | 'Aborigine-ERG:pt-EMPH1'       |
| báma-ngka-kù-lu          | 'Aborigine-ERG:pt-EMPH1-EMPH2' |
| búlkiji-ku               | 'pipi-EMPH1'                   |
| búlkiji-mùn-bu           | 'pipi-mun-LOC'6                |
| búlkiji-mun-bù-ku        | 'pipi-mun-LOC-EMPH1'           |
| yárraman-ànda-kù-lu      | 'horse-LOC:pt-EMPH1-EMPH2'     |
| bímakay-kàrra-ngka-kù-lu | 'FZ-KPL-ERG:pt-EMPH1-EMPH2'    |

However, this secondary stress rule does not apply to the combination of suffix + clitic -baja + ku 'very' attached to an adjective (see §3.2.3 .8). None of the syllables in this sequence are stressed, e.g. yalbay-baja-ku. (See Hershberger and Pike 1 970:802, who regard bajaku as a 'word'; however, the consistent absence of stress contradicts this interpretation. )

But again, secondary stress is not obligatory and is in fact apparent only in slow and careful speech. In normal speech, even in long words of up to eight syllables, only the first syllable is stressed, with pitch subsiding over the following two or three syllables and remaining level over the rest. (Such long words are rare, but stems with inflections and clitics consisting of up to five or six syllables are fairly common in discourse.)

## 2.6.2 Clause stress

Clause stress conforms to the word-stress pattern; that is, it falls on the first syllable of a word. It is characterised by higher pitch and loudness as compared to other clause constituents where regular word stress is less prominent.

Hershberger and Pike ( 1 970:792-802) posit rules for obligatory and optional stress for different types of declarative and interrogative clauses. I suggest that it is possible to generalise these rules, saying that each clause has an unmarked stress pattern which may be

<sup>6</sup> For Catalytic suffix -mun- see §3.2.3. 1.

changed, if the speaker wants to assign special emphasis to a particular clause constituent. The unmarked stress patterns are as follows: 

- (i) In a simple statement with only two constituents, subject (topic) and predicate (comment), clause stress, indicated by , before the vowel, falls on the predicate (see Hershberger & Pike 1970:794), for example:
	- (1) lawunkarra k'aday. '(Our) friends are coming.'
	- (2) Kirrbaji y'albay. `The dugong is big.'
- (ii) In a simple statement with more than two constituents, clause stress falls on the constituent immediately preceding the predicator (see Hershberger & Pike 1970:793, 3.1), for example:
	- (3) Kayangka b'ajibay nukany. `The dog ate a bone.'
	- (4) Kaya m'inyaka wawu. 'The dog wants meat.'
	- (5) Kayangka ngayku m'inya nukany. ‘The dog ate my meat.’
	- (6) Kayangka yunu minya ng'awuya nukany. 'The dog ate your turtle meat.'
	- (7) Kaya j'inbal wanarriy. ‘The dog is running fast.’
	- (8) Nyulu y'ilayku kadany. ‘He came yesterday.’
	- (9) Maral b'ayanba bundanday. ‘The girl is staying in the house.’

Hershberger and Pike (1970:801) state that if the stressed clause component is a noun phrase with two or more constituents, each of these constituents is stressed equally strongly. However, according to my observations, it is only the last word in the phrase which receives most prominent clause stress, as in (5) and (6). 

The same unmarked pattern of pre-predicator clause stress applies for negative statements; that is, stress is on the negative particle *kari*, which precedes the predicator: 

- (10) *Nyulu jarba k'ari nyajiny.*  'He did not see the snake.'
- (11) *Ngayu mayi diburr k'ari nukany.* ‘I did not eat the egg(s).’
- (iii) (a) In a content interrogative clause the interrogative pronoun is stressed (see Hershberger & Pike 1970:195):
- (12) W'anyangka mayi nukany? 'Who ate the food?'
- ( 1 3) Yundu w'anyu nyajiny? 'What did you see?'
- (14) Yundu w'anjabu dungay? 'Where are you going?'

The above sentences show unmarked word order, but an interrogative pronoun may occur anywhere in the clause and still attracts clause stress, for example:

- ( 1 2) a. Mayi w'anyangka nukany?
- (13) a. W'anyu yundu nyajiny?
- (14) a. Yundu dungay w'anjabu?
- (iii) (b) In a polar question the predicator is stressed (see Hershberger & Pike 1 970:796):
	- ( 1 5) Yundu jalbu ny'ajiny? 'Did you see the woman?'
	- (16) Yundu d'akuy? 'Are you hungry?'
	- (17) Nyulu d'ungany? 'Did he go?'

This means that polar questions and statements with only two constituents have basically same stress assignment (see (i) above); however, they differ in the level of pitch, which will be discussed below in §2.6.3 .

Following clause stress rule (ii), a speaker can emphasise a particular clause constituent by moving it to the normally stressed pre-predicator position, for example:

( 1 8) Kayangka minya ng'ayku nukany. 'The dog ate illY meat.' cf. (5)

However, any constituent may be stressed for emphasis anywhere in the clause, overruling the unmarked stress pattern of the particular clause type, for example:

| (19) | J'awunkarra kaday.<br>' (Our) friends are coming.' | cf. (1) |
|------|----------------------------------------------------|---------|
| (20) | K'irrbaji yalbay.<br>'The dugong is big.'          | cf. (2) |

which could be used in answer to the questions 'who is coming?' and 'what is big?'. Further examples of marked stress patterns are:

- (2 1) Mayi m'ayngku nyulu nukany. 'He ate mangoes.'
- (22) Y'ilayku nyulu kadany. 'He came yesterday. '
- (23) Yilayku nyulu k'adany. 'He came yesterday.'
- (24) Ngayu d'iburr kari nukany. 'I did not eat the � (but something else). '
- (25) Wanyangka mayi j'anbal nukany. 'Who ate the guandongs?'
- (26) Yundu j'albu nyajiny? 'Did you see the woman?'
- (27) Nyulu k'irayku dungany? 'Did he go secretly?'

If a polar question contains an adverb, as in (27), stress is in fact usually placed on the adverb, but it may also occur on the verb (see stress rule (iii) b) according to what the speaker enquires about (see Hershberger & Pike 1 970:796).

In tag constructions, which repeat a constituent in nominal form at the end of a clause, after it occurred in pronominal form in its normal clause position, the added noun, which is set off by a slight pause, receives secondary stress. For instance (a comma ',' indicates pause):

- (28) Nyulu ngayku m'inya nukany, kayangka. 'It ate my meat, the dog did.'
- (29) N gayu ny'ungun nyajiny, yinya jalbu. 'I saw her, that woman.'

The same applies, where the subject is given as an 'afterthought', to clarify the reference of a topic noun (thought at first to have a clear referent), for example:

(30) N gayku m'inya nukany, kayangka. 'Ate my meat - the dog. '

In reprise constructions, on the other hand, which prepose a noun phrase that is then followed by a pronoun in normal clause position (see §5.4. 1 ), the preposed constituent receives primary stress, and the stressed constituent of the actual clause receives secondary stress, indicated by ". There is a slight pause after the preposed noun.

- (3 1) K'ayangka, nyulu ngayku m "inya nukany. 'The dog, it ate my meat. '
- (32) Yinya j'albu, ngayu nyungun ny" ajiny. 'That woman, I saw her. '

If the object-NP is preposed, it is usually the verb, and not the pre-predicator constituent, which receives secondary stress.

#### 2.6.3 Intonation contours

Independent statements have intonation contours that peak at clause stress and fall at the end of the clause (see Hershberger & Pike 1 970:802). Thus (3) and ( 1 2), for example, have the intonation contours

![](_page_9_Figure_3.jpeg)

Similarly, tag and reprise constructions have the intonation contours:

![](_page_9_Figure_5.jpeg)

(36) Kayangka, nyulu ngayku minya nukany. see (31)

When clauses are co-ordinated or subordinated, the intonation pattern is quite different.7 The intonation peak is characterised by higher-than-clause stress pitch, but not loudness. It falls on the final syllable of the clause, followed by a slight pause. The otherwise wordstressed penultimate syllable is usually lengthened, but not stressed. Clause stress in the first clause is normal in pitch and loudness, but weakened in following clauses, for example:

![](_page_9_Figure_9.jpeg)

(37) lana wawubajanga ka·dany, mayi wajuny, nu·kany, wunanany. 'They came to the river, cooked food, ate, and slept.'

In subordinated structures, the final rise in the non-final clause carries over into the following clause, usually without a pause in between:

![](_page_9_Figure_12.jpeg)

(38) Ngayu wawubajanga dungay kuyu maninka. 'I go to the river to get some fish. '

<sup>7</sup> See Hershberger and Pike (1970:803) "sequence contour"; their example is unclear in that the final intonation rise and the English gloss suggest a further co-ordinated clause, in which case the intonation contour of the second clause would not be quite as high initially.
