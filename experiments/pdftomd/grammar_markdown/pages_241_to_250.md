# Appendix: texts

The following four texts serve to illustrate not only aspects of Kuku Yalanji grammar and discourse structure but also the unrestricted and active use of this language to communicate all types of subject matter, ranging from everyday events to traditional stories. All four texts, as indeed most of my collection of narratives, were told spontaneously.

The most prolific narrators as well as capable editors of their own texts were the Kuku Nyungkul speakers Charlie Tayley and Bobby Roberts, both in their fifties. Born in Cooktown, Charlie Tayley was taken on as a station hand in his early teens by the owner of Greenhill Station. He worked on a number of stations in the south-eastern part of the Cape York Peninsula, droving cattle from as far north as Wakooka Station on Princess Charlotte Bay to as far south as Bowen, before settling at Wujal Wujal with his family to allow his children a regular school education. At the time of my fieldwork in Wujal Wujal he was the head stockman of the mission and was acknowledged as a good storyteller by the community. He passed away in the mid 1 980s. During his days as a drover, in the company of older Kuku Nyungkul, Kuku Yalanji and also Guugu Yimidhirr speakers, he acquired a large repertoire of mythical stories (text 51 is one example) and tales from the time of the Palmer River goldrush ( 1 873 to about 1 885). He also had many of his own anecdotes to tell from his childhood and droving times. His source of Palmer River goldrush stories was an old man, Billy Charcoal, who lived at Laura Station and would entertain the young stockmen with eyewitness accounts of fighting, guerilla warfare and trickery on the part of the Aborigines, who fought a bitter but losing battle for their lives against the marauding European and Chinese intruders.} Text 12 is one of the tamer stories from this time.

Bobby Roberts spent his childhood and youth on Palm Island, where his parents had been transported when he was only a small boy. He grew up speaking English, the lingua franca among Aborigines from different tribes who lived together on the prison island and attended school. From his parents he acquired only a basic knowledge of Kuku Nyungkul. On returning to the Bloomfield River in his early twenties he made a conscious effort to learn his tribal language properly from the older people, as well as acquiring information on bushcraft, native food and traditional customs. He took it upon himself to devise lessons for me on these subjects, providing me first of all with the necessary vocabulary and then illustrating his topics with narratives. Text 36 was part of one such lesson, dealing with the significance of dreams. Bobby Roberts passed away in the mid 1 980s.

Ivy Walker, a Kuku Yalanji speaker in her mid-forties, had lived all her life in her tribal country. She had a thorough knowledge of Yalanji myths and folklore, but her favoured topics of conversation were family matters and events from her own life, particularly

camping trips that her family had undertaken together with Chris Anderson, an anthropologist from the University of Queensland, whom she called "younger brother". The excerpts in text 3 are taken from a very long narrative recounting a week-long trip to Shiptons Flat, her husband Johnny Walker's (Kuku NyungkuI) traditional territory. The text was transcribed and edited to some extent with the help of Queenie Dick in 1 979. Owing to Ivy Walker's sudden death early in 1981 no final checking and editing of her texts was possible.
