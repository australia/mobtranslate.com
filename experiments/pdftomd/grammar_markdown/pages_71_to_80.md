### 3.2.3. 1 Catalytic Suffix -ffiun-

With trisyllabic nominal roots or sterns and English loan words with any number of syllables (see §3.12) a catalytic suffix which has the form -mun- is inserted between the root and a non-zero inflection. Suffix -mun- does not alter the normal stress pattern of a word as outlined in §2.6.1. Some examples are:

| bimakay-mun-ungku  | '(not ego's) father's.sister-mun-ERG:pt' |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------|
| kunjuri-mun-du     | 'shield-mun-INST'                        |
| bulkiji-mun-ku     | 'pipi-mun-DAT'                           |
| mungari-mun-bu     | 'Kauri.pine-mun-LOC'                     |
| kalka-ji-mun-ungku | 'spear-COMIT-mun-ERG:pt'                 |

Not all speakers follow this convention consistently, but conservative-minded speakers emphasised that these were the correct forms and leaving out the catalytic suffix would be "not right". (This catalytic suffix is glossed as -mun- in interlinear morpheme glosses.)

#### 3.2.3.2 JDossessive

Alienable possession is expressed by derivational affixes attached to the possessor noun. These suffixes differ according to whether the derived stem has zero inflection (absolutive case) or non-zero inflection; the former also show formal differences in the Yalanji and Nyungkul dialects.

Inalienable possession, such as body parts, may also be indicated by these derivational suffixes, but normally possessor and inalienably possessed noun are simply juxtaposed in a noun phrase without possessive affixation (see §4.5.2). The Yalanji and Nyungkul forms of possessive suffixes are listed in Table 3.2.

|                       | Yalanji      | Nyungkul     |
|-----------------------|--------------|--------------|
| + zero inflection     | -mu/V-       | -ngV/V-      |
|                       | -Vmu/C-      | -VngV/C-     |
| + non-zero inflection | -ndVmun-/V-  | -ndVmun-/V-  |
|                       | -VndVmun-/C- | -VndVmun-/C- |

## Table 3.2: Possessive suffixes in Yalanji and Nyungkul

The posseSSIve suffix that is used preceding non-zero inflection could possibly be analysed as

potent locative + catalytic suffix -mun-.2

<sup>2</sup>For catalytic suffix -*mun*- see §3.2.3.1. The stem-forming possessive suffix with non-zero inflection in Guugu Yimidhirr is - :ga + -mu-. -mu- is a catalytic suffix like Kuku Yalanji -mun-, and - :ga is interpreted by Haviland ( 1979a:56) as being related to either abessive or goal. (In Djabugay a catalytic suffix, usually -mu-, is added to the regular possessive stem before a non-zero inflection (patz 1991 :269).

Apart from the formal similarity between locative and possessive (see also §3 .2.4), the two constructions also overlap to some extent in function (see §4.5.5.) . .

Some examples of possessive noun phrases in absolutive case in both dialects are:

| Yalanji           | Nyungkul           |                    |
|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| kambi ngamu-mu    | kambi ngamu-ngu    | 'mother's clothes' |
| mayi kaya-mu      | mayi kaya-nga      | 'the dog's food'   |
| dambal maral-amu  | dambal maral-anga  | 'the girl's shoes' |
| bayan dingkar-amu | bayan dingkar-anga | 'the man's shoes'  |

Non-zero inflections on possessive stems are invariably from the neutral set. Some examples in sentences are:

| (44) | Jalbu-ndumun-du                   | dunyu-ngku        | bikibiki   | kuni-ny.       |
|------|-----------------------------------|-------------------|------------|----------------|
|      | woman-POSS-ERG(A)                 | husband-ERG:pt(A) | pig.ABS(O) | hit/shoot-PAST |
|      | 'The woman's husband shot a pig.' |                   |            |                |

- (45) N gayu dunga-y bayan-ba I sg.NOM(S) go-NONPAS[ house-LOC 'I am going to granny's house.' kami-ndamun-bu. FFIMM-POSS-LOC
- (46) N gamu-ngku maral-andamun-bu kuyu mani-ny. mother-ERG:pt(A) girl-POSS-ERG(A) fish.ABS(O) get-PAS[ 'The girl's mother caught a fish.'
- (47) Nyulu yinil kaya-nka karrkay-andamun-ku. 3sg.NOM(S) afraid dog-DAT:pt child-POSS-DAT 'He/she is afraid of the child's dog.'

Apparently there is no separate affix to express 'possessor of a possessor' in either dialect. Such constructions, which were only obtainable in elicitation and are therefore probably forced or stilted, show the normal possessive suffix on both possessor nouns, for example:

- (48) Dingkar-amu ngamu-mu bayan yalbay. man-POSS.ABS(S) mother-POSS.ABS(S) house.ABS(S) big 'The man's mother's house is big.'
- (49) Nyulu kada-ny maral-andamun-muny yaba-ndamun-muny 3sg.NOM(S) come-PAS[ girl-POSS-ABL eB-POSS-ABL bayan-muny. house-ABL 'He came from the girl's elder brother's house.'

For a full discussion of possessive constructions, see §4.5.

#### 3.2.3.3 Comitative

Like most Australian languages Kuku Yalanji has a derivational suffix which indicates, broadly termed, 'with noun' or 'having noun'. A comitative form in Kuku Yalanji may have either attributive function or indicate 'accompaniment' of a person in motion or rest. (For a detailed discussion see §4.6.1 .)

Like case inflections, the comitative suffix has a neutral and a potent variant. Furthermore, slightly different forms are used, if the derived stem takes zero inflection or non-zero inflection. The forms of comitative suffix are set out in Table 3.3. These allomorphs have been used most consistently in elicitation and are generally regarded as the correct forms. However, in normal speech speakers tend to use -iji and -ji in free variation after a rhotic, and forms with or without final -rr in free variation before any inflectional ending.

|                                               | Neutral         | Potent     |
|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------|------------|
| + zero inflection                             | -iji/R-         | -nji/V-    |
| + non-zero inflection<br>with initial n or ng | -ji/elsewhere   | -Vnji/C-   |
| + non-zero inflection                         | -ijirr/R-       | -njirr/V-  |
| with initial stop or m                        | -jirr/elsewhere | -Vnjirr/C- |

| Table 3.3: Allomorphs of comitative suffix in Kuku Yalanji |       |
|------------------------------------------------------------|-------|
|                                                            | -da   |
|                                                            | -ga   |
|                                                            | -bada |
|                                                            | -baga |

These forms are obviously cognate to the comitative suffixes in the genetically related languages: Yidiny -ji ,.." -yi, Djabugay -i ,.." -nyji ,.." - :rr, and Guugu Yimidhirr -dhirr. It appears that the Guugu Yimidhirr suffix is the most conservative form (cf. -girri in Warrgamay, further south than Yidiny, -dharri in Wirandharri, a Victorian language (Dixon 1 980:325)), whereas the related languages have generally dropped the final -rr but for a few allomorphs, e.g. - :rr/V- in Djabugay, and the suffixes preceding some non-zero inflections in Kuku Yalanji. But even in this environment Kuku Yalanji seems to be gradually losing the final -rr.

Some examples of comitative stems with zero inflection are:

Neutral suffixes

| bulbur-iji      | 'with dust, dusty'     |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| jukar-iji       | 'with sand, sandy'     |
| walarr-iji      | 'with a beard'         |
| juku-ji         | 'with a stick'         |
| kaka-ji         | 'with pain, painful'   |
| milbal-ji       | 'with tears, tearful'  |
| ngunyin-ji      | 'with a dillybag'      |
| Potent suffixes |                        |
| yaba-nji        | 'with elder brother'   |
| yabuju-nji      | 'with younger brother' |
| nganjan-anji    | 'with father'          |
| jawun-unji      | 'with a friend'        |
| kadar-anji      | 'with a wallaby'       |

Some examples of comitative stems with non-zero inflection are:

| (50) | Ngayu<br>1sg.NOM(S)                | jalbu-ndu<br>woman-LOC:pt | dunga-y<br>go-NONPAST | ngawa-nji-nda.<br>baby-COMIT-LOC:pt |
|------|------------------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------|

- (5 1) Warru-ngku kuli-ji-ngka kamukamu nuka-ny. yg.man-ERG:pt(A) rage-COMIT-ERG:pt(A) 'The wild young chap drank alcohol.' alcohol.ABS(O) eat/drink-PAST

- (53) Nyulu warri-ny bubu-muny dubu-njirr-muny. 3sg.NOM(S) run-PAST place-ABL ghost-COMIT-ABL 'He ran from the place with the ghost. '

More examples are given in §4.6. 1.

# 3.2.3.4 Privative

A nominal stem meaning 'without noun' or 'noun-less' may be formed by suffixing the negative particle kari to a nominal root. The resulting stem is clearly definable as one word because of the stress pattern (only the first syllable is stressed), and because a non-zero inflection can only be attached after -kari-.

Privative stem formation is far less productive than comitative stem formation (see §4.6.2) and privative stems are seldom used in other than equational sentences, so a privative stem rarely occurs with non-zero inflection. Some examples of privative stems in equational sentences are:

- (54) Yinya bama milka-kari. that.ABS(S) Aborigine.ABS(S) ear-PRIV 'That Aborigine is deaf.' (lit. no ears)
- (55) Ngayu mani-kari. I sg.NOM(S) money-PRIV 'I have no money.'
- (56) Juku-juku nganka-kari. tree-REDUP.ABS(S) flower-PRIV 'The trees have no flowers.'

Some examples of privative stems with non-zero inflections are:

- (57) Kaya-kari-ngka bikibiki kari warmba-bunga-ny. dog-PRIV-ERG:pt(A) pig.ABS(O) NEG uncovered-CAUS-PAST 'The one without a dog found no pigs'.
- (58) Ngayu wawu bangkarr-ka bajibay-kari-ka. I sg.NOM(S) want meat/steak-DAT bone-PRIV-DAT 'I want meat without bones.'
- (59) Jana kambi daji-ny maral-anda mani-kari-nda. 3pl.NOM(A) clothes.ABS(O) give-PAST girl-LOc:pt money-PRIV-LOC:pt 'They gave clothes to the girl with no money.'

Some speakers prefer neutral inflections with privative sterns, e.g. kaya-kari-bu in (57) and maral-anda mani-kari-ng.a in (59).

# 3.2.3.5 Number

A simple root by itself generally implies a singular referent in Kuku Yalanji (except for mass nouns), for example:

| jalbu    | 'a woman' |
|----------|-----------|
| wawubaja | 'a river' |

In context, a plural interpretation of a simple root is possible, as for instance in (65) below: nganjirr 'grass trees'. To specify more than one referent a quantifier (see §3.2.5) may be used together with a simple root, for example:

| bama wubul   | 'many Aborigines' |
|--------------|-------------------|
| jarba jambul | 'two snakes'      |

Apart from this there are three derivations which can indicate plural or dual.

# (i) Reduplication

Reduplication of the noun root is the normal device to imply general plural, for example:

| wulman-wulman       | 'old men'               |
|---------------------|-------------------------|
| kangkal-kangkal     | 'own children'          |
| kumu-kumu           | 'mosquitoes'            |
| bilngkumu-bilngkumu | 'salt-water crocodiles' |
| juku-juku           | 'trees'                 |

- (60) Baral-baral duna julbarr. pathlroad-REDUP.ABS(S) wet slippery 'The roads are wet and slippery. '
- (6 1) Maral-maral-angka bulkiji wubul baka-ny. girl-REDUP-ERG:pt(A) pipi.ABS(O) many.ABS(O) dig-PAST 'The girls dug up a lot of pipis.' (a type of small salt-water mussel)

(Adjectives are reduplicated to fulfil adverbial function (see §3.8.6.2.).)

# (li) Kinship plural

Kinship terms (including jawun 'unspecified relative, friend' but excluding kangkal 'own child') are not reduplicated for plural, but take the derivational suffix -karra- instead, for example:

| dunyu-karra    | 'husbands'              |
|----------------|-------------------------|
| yabuju-karra   | 'younger brothers'      |
| ngaji-karra    | 'maternal grandfathers' |
| ngalayan-karra | 'fathers-in-law'        |

(62) Nyulu jawun-karra-nda kunja-n-kunjaji-ny mayi-ka. 3sg.NOM(S) friend-KPL-LOC:pt ask.for-n-REDUP-PAST food-DAT 'He was asking around for food among his friends.'

(63) Jana-nda 3pl-LOc:pt mani-nka!" get-pURP manyarr-karra-ngka yalama-ny: wife-KPL-ERG:pt(A) say-PAST 'The wives said to them: "Go to get some fish!'" "Dunga-y kuyu go-IMP fish.ABS(O)

The cognate 'collective plural' suffix -garr in Guugu Yimidhirr has wider application than the Kuku Yalanji suffix in that it can occur with any noun, e.g. guda-garr 'dogs'. On the other hand, with kinship terms it seems to have a more restricted meaning in that it implies "that several people stand in the same relation to a single other" (Haviland 1 979a:55), e.g. gaarga-garr 'younger brothers of a single person'. In Kuku Yalanji -karra apparently does not imply relationship to just one person, but simply indicates plural, as for instance in (63), and:

(64) N gamu-karra nganjan-karra school-mun-bu dunga-y mother -KPL.ABS(S) father -KPL.ABS(S) school-mun-LOC go-NONP AST

teacher-mun-unji balka-wa-nka.

teacher -mun-COMIT:pt talk -RECIP-PURP

'The mothers and fathers go to the school to talk with the teacher.' (i.e. the parents in the community, not just the parents of a single person)

# (iii) Derivational suffix -bulal 'pair'

This derivational suffix is obviously related to the dual pronoun bula '3. person dual' (see §3 .5.1). It is most frequently used with nouns with human reference and the noun phrase often also includes the dual pronoun and/or the quantifier jambul 'two' as for instance in text 51, line 1 and:

(65) Bula jalbu-bulal-angka dubu waju-ny nganjirr-da. 3du.NOM(A) woman-pair-ERG:pt(A) ghost.ABS(O) bum-PAST grass tree-INST 'The two women burnt the ghost with [burning] grass trees.' (from a story about two women avenging the theft of their children by a ghost)

The use of -bulal implies some intrinsic link between the two referents, that they somehow belong together and act together. To indicate simply 'two', without wanting to imply some connection between the referents, the quantifier jambul 'two' is used.3

# Consider:

- (66) a. Yarraman-bulal kankada-y. horse-pair .ABS(S) come.REDUP-NONP AST 'The pair of horses is coming.' (e.g. a mare and her foal that are always together)
	- b. Yarraman jambul wawubaja-nga wanarri-y. horse.ABS(S) two.ABS(S) river-LOC run.REDUP-NONPAST 'Two horses are running to the river.' (they don't belong together)

3 Compare the use of derivational suffix -dpran 'two, each of two' and adjective bulay 'two' in Dyirbal (Dixon 1 972:228-229)

- (67) a. luku-bulal ymyay janjana-y. tree-pair.ABS(S) there stand.REDUP-NONPAST 'A pair of trees is standing there. ' (e.g. standing close together and perhaps of the same kind and size)
	- b. Ngayu jambul juku nyaji-ny. I sg.NOM(A) two.ABS(O) tree.ABS(O) see-PAST 'I saw two trees.' (e.g. one by the roadside and one on the beach)

## 3.2.3.6 Nominalising SUffix -nyV

A noun stem may be derived from a verb by affixation of -nya after final vowels a or i, or -nyu after final vowel u.4 This suffix is identical in form with the unmarked verbal inflection with subordinating discourse function in the Nyungkul dialect and the 'causal' subordinate inflection (see §3.8.4.2 (viii)) and a clear distinction between -nyV as a verb inflection and -nyV as a nominaliser is not possible. For instance, a -nyV form may have habitual implication (see H. Hershberger & R. Hershberger 1 982:284) which could well represent a nominal form:

(68) Nyulu minya nuka-nya. 'He always eats meat. ' OR 'He is a habitual meat-eater.'

But I have not encountered constructions like this with further case inflections, as for instance 'the habitual meat-eater-ERG shot a pig'. In my experience, -nyV stems with further case inflections occur only in 'simultaneous', 'prior event' and 'hypothetical reason' subordinate clauses (see §4.4.4). In these uses nominal stems with -nyV have basically a subordinating role, i.e. they are functionally similar to verb + -nyV forms in 'causal' subordinate clause (see §4.4.4.2) and in subordinate 'non-event' marking in discourse (see §5.5.1 .2). Neither of these can take any case inflections. It may therefore be possible that verbal inflection -nyV and nominal stem-forming suffix -nyV are related.

F. Merlan (1 98 1) addresses a similar problem in Mangarayi, a language of the western Roper River area, where "The same verbal prefix forms are used to mark: (i) irrealis mood; (ii) generalised subordinate clauses ( ... ); and (iii) an inflectional 'habitual' category of the verb ( ... )" (1981:1 75). She concludes that, "Basically, the shared function of such markers is to signal that the basis for interpretation of the predicates to which they are affixed is not given there, but is to be found within the fairly immediate linguistic context" (1981 :208). Thus the function of this Mangarayi prefix seems to be similar to the general subordinating function of suffix -ny V in Kuku Yalanji.

## 3.2.3. 7 Other noun derivations

There are some derivational affixes in Kuku Yalanji that add, broadly termed, a semantic aspect of 'personal characteristic' to a noun root or stem. These are -( w)arra 'inhabitants of', -baka 'excessive' and mala- 'expert'.

<sup>4</sup> For vowel-harmony rules see §2.S.1

# (i) -(w)arra 'inhabitants of'

This suffix attaches to proper place names or comitative stems referring to characteristics of larger areas (see §1.2. 1 (i) for area distinctions in Kuku Yalanji) and has the meaning ‘inhabitant(s) of X or native of X’. Its allomorphs are:

-warra/V -arra/C-

In Kuku Yalanji this derivational suffix also apparently implies plurality, i.e. there is no attested use of -(w)arra in reference to just one person, for example:

| jalun-ji-warra | 'seaside people'   |
|----------------|--------------------|
| mangkal-arra   | 'Cedar Bay people' |

- (69) K ubirri-warra wujalwujal-arra-nda (Mossman)-inhab.ABS(S) (Bloomfield)-inhab-LOC:pt 'The Mossman people went to the Bloomfield people. ' dunga-ny. gO-PAST
- (70) Maja-ji-warra-ngka kurranji scrub-COMIT -inhab-ERG:pt(A) cassowary.ABS(O) 'The scrub people killed many cassowaries. ' wubul kuni-ny. many.ABS(O) hitJkill-PAST

This suffix has cognates in all the genetically related languages (warra in Guugu Yimidhirr, -barra in Djabugay and Yidiny) as well as in many other languages of southern and central Queensland (see Tindale 1 974).

Haviland ( 1 979a:64) has interpreted warra in Guugu Yimidhirr as an "independent particle with nominal expression", but in Kuku Yalanji -(w)arra is clearly a suffix, as is shown by the allomorphic variation according to the final root or stem segment.

#### (ii) -baka 'excessive (characteristic)

Suffix -baka attached to a simple or reduplicated noun root, usually with abstract reference, indicates that the reference of the noun applies excessively to someone, i.e. 'too much noun' or 'excessively noun', which has always negative connotations. The derived stem generally functions as a noun rather than an adjective and is often used as a kind of proper noun in reference to a person, for example:

> kuli-baka rage-excess 'excessively wild/grumpy person or animal'

jalbu-baka jalbu-jalbu-baka woman-REDUP-excess 'notorious womaniser'

kuru-baka fem.lovellust -excess 'flirtatious, "easy" woman'

ngirray-baka weeping(noun)-excess 'crybaby'

As can be seen in the above examples, a noun root in connection with -baka may have an extended meaning. For instance, jalbu-baka is not an excessively feminine person but a lecherous male. The semantic extension can go even further, for example: 

> dirra-baka tooth-excess 'someone who swears too much'

Some examples of these derivations in sentences are:

- (7 1) N gayu yinil kuli-baka-nka. <sup>1</sup>sg.NOM(S) afraid rage-ex cess-DA T:pt 'I am scared of the wild one.'
- (72) Nyulu jalbu-baka-ngka maral dumbarri-ny 3sg.NOM(A) woman-excess-ERG:pt(A) girLABS(O) break-PAST buyun-dama-ny. bad-CADS-PAST 'The womaniser raped a girL '

An 'excessive' nominal stem may also be used with no reference to anyone in particular, but as a general lament about a deplorable situation, for example: 

(73) *Kamu-kamu-baka!* 'There is too much drinking going on around here!' 

(74) *Nyurra-baka!* 'There is too much noise around here!' (nyurra 'irritating noise of people shouting and laughing’)

#### (iii) *Mala-* 'expert'

A nominal stem formed with mala- attached to a noun root has the semantic content ‘good at noun’ or ‘noun expert’, for example:

| <i>mala-kalka</i> | 'spear expert'                                                     |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <i>mala-minya</i> | 'good hunter, game expert'                                         |
| <i>mala-mayi</i>  | 'good cook, food expert'                                           |
| <i>mala-burri</i> | 'good singer, song expert' ( <i>burri</i> ‘name, corroboree song’) |

- (75) Charlie mala-bulki. Charlie.ABS(S) expert-cattle 'Charlie is an expert stockman.'
- (76) Nyulu mala-mayi-ngka 3sg.NOM(A) expert-food-ERG:ptCA) 'The good cook cut up the fish.' kuyu yaka-ny. fish.ABS(O) cut-PAST
- (77) Mala-balji-nda babaji-ka balji-ka. expert-dillybag-LOC:pt ask.about-IMP dillybag-DAT 'Ask the dillybag expert about diUybags !'

The original meaning of this prefix is probably 'hand' since there are cognates mala 'palm of hand' in Yidiny and 'hand' in Dyirbal, south of Yidiny (cf. English 'he is handy atlhas a hand for woodwork'). The word for 'hand' in Kuku Yalanji and Djabugay is mara, obviously cognate to the Yidiny and Dyirbal forms. While mara is a free noun root, mala- cannot occur on its own in Kuku Yalanji. It is interesting to note that the intonation pattern of mala- stems is not consistent. Sometimes the first stem syllable is stressed, e.g. mala-minya, which concurs with the normal word-stress pattern, but more often only the first root syllable is stressed, e.g. mala-m{nya. This might indicate that mala- is in fact treated as a pro-clitic rather than a stem-forming prefix.

One Nyungkul speaker also used mala- with nominalised verb stems (see §3.2.3.6), e.g. mala-dunga-nya 'good at getting away' (text 1 2, line 1 8) or mala-bundanda-nya '(always) sitting comfortably (and unworried), (text 1 2, line 55). This use of mala- was not confirmed by other speakers, who only attach it to noun roots.

#### 3.2.3.8 'Degree' of adjective

There are two affixes which occur only with adjectives or comitative stems in attributive or adjectival function (for comitative see §4.6. 1 ). They indicate the degree or intensity of the property described by the adjective.

(i) Jarra- 'rather, more'

Jarra- preceding an adjective indicates 'fairly' or 'rather adjective', for example:

| jarra-yalbay | 'rather big'  |
|--------------|---------------|
| jarra-minday | 'rather tame' |
