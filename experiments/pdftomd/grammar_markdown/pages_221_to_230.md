# 5 Narrative discourse

#### 5.1 Preliminary remarks

Above the sentence level any language displays regularities in the way in which topics are introduced, reference is maintained, information is ordered, turn-taking is achieved, feedback is prompted and given and many other aspects of discourse are handled. Brown and Yule (1983:22) define a "regularity" in discourse as "a linguistic feature which occurs in a definable environment with a significant frequency".

This chapter is concerned with linguistic features that fulfil certain discourse functions in Kuku Yalanji narratives. The narrative has been chosen as an unambiguously definable environment, i.e. a text in which the topic is identified by the narrator ("this is a story about ... "), and there is a beginning, purposeful progression through a plot, and an end. Within such a framework regularities can be identified and compared across several texts. ! Neither conversational structures nor any other genres of discourse are investigated here.

In these narratives I have concentrated on cohesion, choice and marking of topic, and the distinction between events and non-events. This choice was guided partly by concepts provided in Grimes The thread of discourse (1 975), but more importantly by the need to explain the function of varying word order, aspects of noun, pronoun and zero reference and the use of some particles and clitics.

#### 5.2 Cohesion

From the listener's point of view it is of foremost importance that a narrative is cohesive, so that there is no difficulty in understanding which participant does what, where and when. This necessary cohesion includes several aspects: participant identification and progression of the narrative through time and space, as well as the rate at which it progresses.

Halliday and Hasan (1 976) regard cohesion as a semantic concept in the same way as text is a semantic unit. Cohesion is represented in the interdependence of the constituents of a text: "Cohesion occurs where the INTERPRET A TION of some element in the discourse is dependent on that of another" (Halliday & Hasan 1 976:4).

See Brown and Yule ( 1 983 :68ff.) on identifying analysable chunks of discourse.

#### 5.2. 1 Participant Identification

Participant identification first of all has to establish a reference sufficiently well that the audience knows who or what is being talked about, and then has to maintain reference in a manner that prevents confusion on the part of the listener.

Generally speaking, reference maintenance is the domain of pronouns, while nouns are used predominantly to establish reference but may also appear in anaphoric function. Kuku Yalanji frequently combines nouns and pronouns with the pronoun either preceding or following the noun. In keeping with the general convention mentioned above, a pronoun-noun sequence can be assumed to have anaphoric or definite reference, e.g. nyulu jalbu 'the woman' in contrast to a noun on its own, e.g. jalbu '(a) woman' which usually conveys new andlor indefinite reference. A noun-pronoun sequence, on the other hand, normally establishes a new reference which is immediately followed up by an anaphoric element, e.g. jalbu nyulu 'woman, she'. The following sub-sections deal with the application and modification of these basic possibilities.

#### 5.2. 1. 1 Establishing participant reference

The need for detailed identification varies in Kuku Yalanji, and presumably in other languages as well, according to whether the referent is first, second, or third person, singular or non-singular. Reference to first and second person singular and first person dual inclusive participants is established and maintained in Kuku Yalanji discourse simply by the use of pronouns ngayu 'I', yundu 'you sg. ' and ngali 'you and I', since obviously there can be no doubt about the identity of the referent(s).

However, when introducing any participant other than those mentioned above, the speaker will provide additional information in the form of one or more proper or common nouns which may be preceded or followed by an appropriate pronoun. For instance:

Third person singular:

| (611) | Pastor nyulu ...           | 'Pastor, he ...' (text 3, line 9)           |
|-------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| (612) | John Robertamu kangkal ... | 'John Robert's child ...' (text 3, line 34) |
| (613) | Wulbuman ...               | 'An old woman ...' (text 51, line 15)       |

First person dual exclusive:

(6 1 4) Ngaliny yaba-ngka kuyu wubul 3du.exc.NOM(A) eB-ERG:pt(A) fish.ABS(O) many.ABS(O) 'My elder brother and I caught a lot of fish.' mani-ny. get-PAST

Second person dual:

(6 1 5) Yubal 2du.NOM(S) Roderick janji! Roderick.ABS(S) swim. IMP 'You and Roderick have a swim!'

Third person dual:

(6 1 6) Warru-bulal jambul, bula ... yg.man-pair.ABS(S) two.ABS(S) 3du.NOM(S) 'A pair of two young fellows ... ' (text 51, line 1) First person plural inclusive:

(6 1 7) Ngana kangkal-kangkal jilba-dunga-y wunkuny. Ipl.inC.NOM(S) child-REDUP.ABS(S) walk-go-NONPAST tomorrow 'You and I and the children will go walkabout tomorrow. '

# First person plural exclusive:

- (6 1 8) Ngayu babi I sg.NOM(S) FM.ABS(S) wulbuman yindu ngamu old.woman.ABS(S) other.ABS(S) mother.ABS(S) nganjin dunga-ri-ny mayi baka-nka. Ipl.exc.NOM(S) go-PLS-PAST food.ABS(O) dig-PURP 'I, grandmother, another old woman and mother, we went out to dig for food (yams). '
- (6 1 9) Nganjin Mabel balka-n-balka-wa-ny. <sup>1</sup>pl.exc.NOM(S) Mabel.ABS(S) speak -n-REDUP-RECIP-PAST 'We all including Mabel had a long chat. '

Second person plural:

(620) Yurra karrkay dunga-y bana mana! 2pl.NOM(S) child.ABS(S) go-IMP water.ABS(O) get.IMP 'You children go and get water!'

Third person plural:

| (621) | Jalbu-jalbu        | karrkay-karrkay    | jana       | wawubaja-nga |
|-------|--------------------|--------------------|------------|--------------|
|       | woman-REDUP.ABS(S) | child-REDUP.ABS(S) | 3pl.NOM(S) | river-LOC    |

dunga-ny mukirr mani-nka. go-PAST mussel.ABS(S) get-pURP 'Women and children, they went to the river to get mussels.'

(622) Jana Doris kada-ny-baja. 3pl.NOM(S) Doris.ABS(S) come-PAST -again 'Doris and her people came back.'

Constructions of this type are typically used when introducing participants for the first time in a discourse. The frequent combinations of nouns and pronouns can be explained as follows: In examples (6 1 1), (6 1 6), and (62 1 ), all referring to third person participants, the pronoun follows after identification has been established through nouns and the pronoun has anaphoric function. (Incidentally, the tautology in (6 1 6), "a pair (of) two", is a common device when introducing a couple of participants who are thought to belong together.) On the other hand, in examples (6 1 4), (6 1 5), (6 1 7), (6 1 9) and (620), all referring to first or second person participants, the pronoun appears initially as if referring to someone already known. This is indeed the case, since at least one referent in these constructions, i.e. the speaker or the addressee, is defined by the very pronoun. Only where the hitherto unidentified members of a group far outnumber the known member, and are considered relevant by the speaker, is the group pronoun preferred to follow the list of participants as in (6 1 8). Conversely, where one member is deemed sufficient to identify a whole group in a third person plural reference, the pronoun is preferred in initial position, followed by the identifying noun, as in (622) which conveys something like 'Doris and her usual hangers-on, you know who I mean'.

The above examples are the most common conventions for introducing new participants in discourse. Apart from these, a speaker is free to choose other forms for stylistic reasons. He or she may for instance introduce the first character in a narrative, usually if it is the most important one, straight away by what is normally anaphoric reference, as for instance:

- (623) Nyulu karrkay wunanany. 'The child was sleeping.' (text 36, line 1)
- (624) Nyungu bayan wangkar wuburrbu. 'His camp was on top of the mountain.' (text 1 2, line 3)

By this means the speaker quickly draws the audience into the narrative by implying immediate familiarity between the listener and the main character.

Another device is the use of cataphoric demonstrative yanya 'this', as for example in text 51, line 72:

(625) Nyulu wulman yanyabi bundandany. 'There was this old man.'

The old man is introduced as a new participant in this form after about two-thirds of the narrative and because of the cataphoric demonstrative we can expect him to do something important, which he does. He reassembles the dog skeleton and resurrects the animal; the old man is in fact the hero of the story.

# 5.2. 1.2 Maintaining participant reference

Kuku Yalanji has a variety of means by which to maintain reference throughout a narrative, including nouns, pronouns, demonstratives, or no overt reference at all. In the previous section we have seen that demonstrative yanya 'this' is used to introduce a new participant with cataphoric implication. Demonstrative yinya 'that', on the other hand, refers back to an already known participant. It is generally used to reintroduce with special emphasis an important participant after the narrative had focused on someone or something else for a while. For instance in text 36 the first text line introduces the main character, the child, with definite reference: Nyulu karrkay wununany 'The child was sleeping'. The next two lines mention that mother and father were also asleep, implying that it was fairly late at night and all was peaceful and quiet. Line 4 then reverts to the main character:

(626) Yinya karrkay nyulu bijarriny. 'That child, he had a dream.'

Later on, the narrator describes how the people went to the river and dived for mussels and then again re-focuses the narrative onto that particular child who had had the dream (lines 25-26):

(627) ... yinya karrkay bada. Yinya janjiny. ' ... that child (went) down. That one dived.'

Thus we may say that demonstratives in Kuku Yalanji have dual function in simultaneously referring to both a participant and his/her prominent role.2 Yanya 'this' establishes this twofold reference, while yinya 'that' maintains it.

<sup>2</sup> See also use of demonstrative 'that' in Guugu Yimidhirr discourse as outlined by Haviland (1979a: 1 56-1 57).

Nouns, pronouns and zero anaphora maintain a less marked reference. It would seem that the use of pronouns alone is possible only where these are sufficient to distinguish between participants - for instance if first person singular ngayu interacts with third person singular nyulu, or third person singular interacts with third person dual bula - but not where two or three third person singular participants are involved. In the latter case nouns can be used for unambiguous reference if switching from one participant to another, e.g. nyulu warru 'the young man' or nyulu wulman 'the old man'. However, Kuku Yalanji narrators can get by with very little nominal reference, indeed with very little overt reference at all, and still be understood.

The main key to referent identity, after it has been established, lies in the context given by the narrative and specifically in contextually appropriate actions performed by the participants. One basic rule is that as long as a common participant is maintained, be it in S, A or ° or even oblique function, no overt reference is required. Thus, if we encounter a stretch of text in Kuku Yalanji narrative where participant reference is omitted, we can safely assume that the participant which had been stated at the beginning of this stretch is involved throughout. For instance text 36, lines 1 1-13; line 11 introduces the participant:

(628) lana bama jabajaba wandiriny .. . 'A whole lot of people turned up ... '

followed by zero reference in the next line. But it is clearly the people, and not the child mentioned earlier, who take torches, flash them about and look under the bed. Another example is in text 3, lines 34-37. Lines 34 and 35 identify the intruder. Line 36 describes an action: Yirrkany 'Called out.' It would be possible that the people in the camp called out to the stranger, but from the zero reference we can infer that it is in fact the stranger who does so. Line 37, again a new clause with zero reference, explains how the stranger got there: Motorbikemunji 'With a motorbike. '

As mentioned above, a contextually appropriate action can be a means of identifying an otherwise unspecified participant. This aspect closely interacts with the principle of zero reference = same participant. Take for instance text 51, lines 49-5 1. The dog (kaya in line 49) runs on and the two fellows (bula) spear it in line 50. There is no reference to the dog in ° function, but it is the dog, and not something else, that got speared. In line 51 the dog is cut up into halves and there is no reference to either A or 0, but there can be no doubt as to who is in what role.

The convention of contextually appropriate participant can even identify a participant in a switch-reference situation with zero anaphora, in which case it overrides the other convention of zero anaphora = same participant. Consider the first part of text 36 where, after initial identification, the participants, the child and the people, are distinguished largely by their actions: the child dreams and screams and the people look for the imaginary crocodile. In lines 1 5-1 8 the child's anguished cries are quoted, followed by a narrator's comment on the intensity of the child's dream in line 19 (zero anaphora = same referent). In the following line there is still no overt reference to an agent, but the verb balbanybaja 'flashed a light again' signals a switch in reference from the child to the people who, as we know, have previously been using a torch. Thus the notion of 'appropriate participant for a role' can override the convention of 'zero anaphora = same participant'.

It appears that these conventions of reference maintenance through contextual appropriateness are the backbone of participant cohesion in a Kuku Yalanji narrative.

#### 5.2. 1.3 Summary

To summarise the most essential points, participant reference in a first introduction is normally established by indefinite nominal NPs, but a definite construction, including cataphoric demonstrative, may be used to imply a certain importance of the referent.

Maintenance of participant reference most commonly involves pronouns or zero anaphora. Where pronouns are indistinct in third person reference and where zero anaphora is applied, participants can be identified according to the following conventions:

(i) zero anaphora/indistinct pronoun = same referent

(ii) zero anaphora/indistinct pronoun = contextually appropriate participant.

Of these, convention (ii) overrides convention (i).

### 5.2.2 Temporal cohesion

Narratives are typically recounted in the past tense in Kuku Yalanji and normally the order in which events are told represents the chronological order in which they take place. However, the sequence of events in a narrative cannot always be strictly linear, since, as in real life, actions by different participants may overlap.

Simultaneous subordinate clauses (see §4.4.4.1) can be used to indicate that actions by two participants occur at the same time. However, the application of simultaneous subordinate clauses is limited to only a very brief time span. If actions by different participants overlap through any length of time, the narrator switches back and forth between them in order to bring the diverging actions 'up to date'. Such a sequence can be found in text 51, lines 37-50. In line 37 the old woman goes off to fetch her dog, as indicated by a purposive clause. From this we can infer that she is occupied for a while as the narrator turns our attention back to the two fellows who are said to take off and run westwards. While the two young men are left running, the narrator switches back to the old woman, who fetches the dog and sets it on the trail of the two young men (lines 40-41 ). The dog then takes over in an active participant role (the old woman drops out of sight) and keeps following the young men. From then on, line 46, participant reference switches with every sentence in "leapfrog fashion" (see Dixon 1 972:7 1) until the unity of time and place is re-established in line 50 where the two fellows kill the dog.

In addition to these systematic reference switches, the clitic -kuda (TEMP2) 'meanwhile' (as in lines 38 and 39 in the above sequence) apparently plays a role in indicating overlapping actions. The function of -kuda is still not entirely transparent3 but its interpretation as 'meanwhile' appears appropriate in many examples, for instance in text 51, lines 38 and 39 and text 3, lines 16 and 1 8, or the following lines from a text recorded by Hershberger and reproduced in a booklet Kuku Ngujuji. (This text does not contain glosses and translation is in the form of an English adaptation; glosses and translation are therefore my own.)

(629) Babi-ngka juwal-da-ku-Iu wadu-li dama-ny. FM-ERG:pt(A) digging.stick-INST-EMPHI-EMPH2 wrong-EMPH2 spear-PAST 'Grandmother missed [the fish] with the digging stick.'

<sup>3</sup>  H. Hershberger and R. Hershberger (1982:1 93) analysed -kuda as 'definitely, for sure', giving the example Nyulu dungaykuda 'He'll go for sure'. However, no context is given for this utterance.

(630) Ngayu-ji-ku-lu naybu-bu-ku I sg.NOM(A)-in.tum-EMPHI -EMPH2 knife-INST-EMPHI

> bana-nga-kuda wadu-kuda nyanda-ny. water-LOC-meanwhile wrong-meanwhile chop-PAST 'While I in tum hacked vainly in the water with a knife.'

Another way to indicate temporal relations in a narrative is the use of temporal clitics -da 'then', -(ng)Vrr 'first of all' and wawu- 'after' (see §3.10.1). Clitic -da indicates that an action follows one or more others, for example:

(63 1) Nganjin wawubaja-nga kada-ny tent ngara-ny IpLexc.NOM(S) river-LOC come-PAST tent.ABS(O) set.up-PAST mayi nuka-ny wuna-ny-da. food.ABS(O) eat-PAST lie-PAST-TEMPI

'We came to the river, set up tent, ate some food and then rested.'

In text 36, for instance, lines 37-38 describe the emergence of the crocodile which grabs the child (line 39) and then takes it underwater:

(632) Karrba-ny, wundi-ny-da,janji-ny-da '[It] grabbed [him], then took [him with it] and dived.' (text 36, line 40)

Clitic -da may be used to close a sequence of events after which either a new participant acts (e.g. the child's parents in text 36, line 41), or some time may elapse before the plot continues. Example (63 1) above, for instance, could be followed by 'Next morning they got up, etc.'.

Clitic -(ng)Vrr, on the other hand, stresses the first action or participant in a sequence, for example:

- (633) Ngayu kuyu waju-l-urr wundi-l-da. I sg.NOM(A) fish.ABS(O) cook-NONPAST-TEMP3 take-NONPAST-TEMPI 'I first cook the fish and then I take it [with me].'
- (634) Queenie-ngka nyulu-ngurr diburr Queenie-ERG:pt(A) 3sg.NOM(A}-TEMP3 egg.ABS(O) 'Queenie was the first to find (lit. get) an egg. ' mani-ny. get-PAST

Clitic wawu- in conjunction with a nominal in ablative case indicates 'after, since', for example:

- (635) Wawu-warngku-muny jana TEMP4-sleep-ABL 3pLNOM(S) 'After the sleep they went on.' dunga-ny-baja. gO-PAsT-again
- (636) Wawu-yinya-muny ngayu yalbay-ma-ny. TEMP4-that-ABL I sg.NOM(S) big-INCHO-PAST 'Since that time I have grown up. '

Time spans during which nothing in particular happens are always bridged by specific temporal reference, such as wunkuny 'next day', muduwajuny 'at daybreak', etc. (for time words see §3.4).

### 5.2.3 Anaphoric linkage

Anaphoric linkage, as defined by Grimes (1975:3 16), is the repetition or paraphrasing of a clause "in dependent form as a means of leading into an independent clause that contains new information". Kuku Yalanji narratives frequently show repetition of clauses or parts of clauses, although not in dependent but rather co-ordinated structures. Clauses may even be repeated in non-co-ordinated form in which case they often show a change in word order. Consider text 51, lines 4-7:

| (637) 4 | Bula<br>yuwulbuwun kada-ny.<br>3du.NOM(S) Jeannie.River come-PAST<br>'They came to the Jeannie River.'                                                                                                                                      |
|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 5       | Bula<br>kada-ny, bula wawubaja-nga dunga-ny.<br>3du.NOM(S) come-PAST 3du.NOM(S) river-LOC go-PAST<br>'They came and they went to the river.'                                                                                                |
| 6       | Bula wawubaja-nga dunga-ny, bula mayi<br>3du.NOM(S) river-LOC go-PAST 3du.NOM(A) fruit.ABS(O)<br>kabal warrmba-bunga-ny.<br>Leichardt.tree.ABS(O) uncovered-CAUS-PAST<br>'They went to the river and they found some Leichardt tree fruit.' |
| 7       | Kabal mayi warrmba-bunga-ny.<br>Leichardt.tree.ABS(O) fruit.ABS(O) uncovered-CAUS-PAST<br>'Leichardt fruit [they] found.'                                                                                                                   |

Even though such sections of text in Kuku Yalanji do not involve dependent structures, the typical repetition of information presumably justifies the use of the term 'anaphoric linkage'. Further examples of anaphoric linkage may be found in text 51, lines 89-9 1 and 97-98, and text 36, lines 39-40.

Anaphoric linkage in Kuku Yalanji narratives is not strictly correlated with the distinction between events and non-events.4 But while it may occur anywhere in a text, its use is apparently favoured in certain situations. Firstly, at the beginning of a narrative (as in the quoted example (637) above), perhaps with the intention of slowly 'warming up' the audience rather than overwhelming them with too much new information. Secondly, it is used immediately preceding a specially important event where it seems that the narrator wants to stall the flow of information to build up tension; and thirdly, at the peak of an event to provide the crucial happening with more impact, as for instance in text 36, when the crocodile grabs the child, or in text 51, when the dog comes back to life.

#### 5.3 Topics

#### 5.3.1 Preliminary remarks

Grimes ( 1 975:323ff.) has attempted to clarify the somewhat confused terminology of 'topic', 'focus', 'theme' and 'emphasis' in linguistic literature. To this end he has introduced

<sup>4</sup> Grimes ( 1975:96) mentions that in Kayapo of Brazil anaphoric linkage is used exclusively for nonevents, so that the auclience is alerted to an important section in the narrative as soon as anaphoric linkage ceases.

the theatrical term 'staging' to refer to the process of presenting a narrative, or parts thereof, from a particular perspective (see Brown & Yule 1 983: 1 34). The speaker arranges his narrative like a stage performance with some participants acting at the centre of the stage and others off-centre, or even leaving the stage and perhaps re-appearing. The decision of who is to be at the centre of the stage is the semantic choice of theme and the practical implementation of this choice is "the designation of a constituent in the grammar as the TOPIC by means of appropriate signaling devices" (Grimes 1 975:324). The continuing and overall process of staging involves the choice of a theme whose overt surface form is the grammatically marked topic in a stretch of discourse. Thus 'theme' is a discourse or semantic term whereas 'topic' is a grammatical one. Since grammatically marked topics constitute the 'theme' in a narrative the grammatical devices for topic marking will be investigated in the following subsections.

# 5.3.2 Topic choice and topic marking

In the following subsections I will look at how topics are represented, and at which is the most common choice of topic in Kuku Yalanji. An investigation of these two questions could easily become circular: can one define a topic by the way in which it is marked or does one find out about topic marking by assuming that certain constituents are topic? The topic as part of a discourse theme is the most prominent or salient feature in a sentence. "Clearly the marking of thematization is related to a semantic factor of PROMINENCE" (Grimes 1 975:327). But how do we know which feature is the most prominent unless the speaker conveys this in some way? The best starting point for an investigation of this problem appears to be the universally applicable feature of prominence in word order.

### 5.3.2. 1 Word order and syntactic function

"Many of the phenomena written off in grammars as free word order are in contrast with each other thematically" (Grimes 1 975:331). Kuku Yalanji, like most Australian languages, has 'free word order', even to the extent that noun phrases may be split up and their constituents distributed throughout the clause. Nevertheless there is a preferred or unmarked word order, which is S/A 0 V. But variations of this unmarked word order are not uncommon and we must assume that this has thematic implications.

According to a universal convention, the leftmost position in a sentence is the most prominent one.5 This means that leftmost position is the natural place for the topic as the most salient constituent. Considering that the preferred word order in Kuku Yalanji is S/A 0 v, the normal choice of topic would therefore be a noun phrase in S or A function. (These functions coincide in form for pronouns but are distinct for nouns.)

Since Kuku Yalanji allows variation in word order, it stands to reason that an 0 NP can be topicalised by simply moving it to leftmost position. This is indeed so, but apparently there must be a good reason why an 0 NP, or even an oblique noun phrase, is to be topicalised; i.e. speakers are not indiscriminate in their choice of what is to be topic. Consider the following examples:

# 210 Chapter 5

(63 (58) Nyulu jina yijarri-ny 3sg.NOM(A) fOOt.ABS(O) put-PAST murraJa-nga. stonefish-LOC 

> Nyunguniny murraja-bu baka-ny. 3sg.ACCCO) stonefish-ERG(A) poke-PAST 'He put [his] foot on a stonefish. The stonefish poked him.' (From a tale about how lina-baji 'sore foot' acquired his nickname.)

(639) text 3, line 44

|------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------|-----------------|

| kangkal-kangkal,                         | ngayu                 | janangan        | murrukanga-ny.  |
| own.child-REDUP.ABS(O)                   | 1sg.NOM(A)            | 3pl.ACC(O)      | scold-PAST      |
| 'I scolded them, Chris and my two sons:' |                       |                 |                 |

(In the latter example, reprise (see §5.4.1) is used to front the 0 NP.)

The above examples are taken out of contexts in which the referents that are in 0 function here had already been established as topic, in S or A function, in the preceding sentences. Furthermore, in (638) there is the additional aspect of the 0 NP referring to a human being, whereas the agent is lower in animacy. (This point will be discussed in the next subsection.) 

Such occurrences of 0 NP in leftmost position as topic must not be confused with instances where zero anaphora applies to the agent. If the 0 NP is in leftmost position in such situations, the unmarked word order is in effect maintained, but the 0 NP is in initial position by default because the agent has zero reference. 

We can thus determine two conditions under which the choice of 0 NP as topic is most likely: 

- (i) If the referent of the 0 NP is of higher animacy than the referent of the A NP;
- (ii) If the referent of the 0 NP has previously been established as topic in another function.

Nevertheless, there seems to be a general reluctance to use an 0 NP as topic. To avoid this, Kuku Yalanji speakers may resort to a passive construction which places the patient in S function, as for instance in text 12, line 53:

(640) Kanbal kuni-ji-ny... some.ABS(S) kill-ITR-PAST 'Some were killed ... ' 

Another way to avoid having an 0 NP as overtly marked topic is zero anaphora in a switch function situation (see below). 

# 5.3.2.2 Switch function

In §5.2.1 .2 we have seen that participants can be referred to by zero anaphora throughout longish parts of a narrative. The criteria for participant identification in such cases are 'same referent' and 'contextually appropriate participant'.
