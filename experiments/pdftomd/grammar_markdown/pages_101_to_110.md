'where at'. My data includes only two occurrences of wanja, but copious examples of wanjabu in both locative and allative sense, for example:

- ( 1 29) Yunu ngamu wanjabu? 2sg.POSS.ABS(S) mother.ABS(S) where 'Where is your mother?'
- ( 1 30) Yundu wanjabu dunga-y? 2sg.NOM(S) where go-NONPAST 'Where are you going?'

Sentence ( 1 30), or simply yundu wanjabu is the common form of greeting people. So it seems that wanja is being wholly replaced by wanjabu. The etymology of wanjabu is obscure. It may possibly have developed from a phrase wanja bubu 'where place'. The paradigm of wanja forms is set out in Table 3.1 1.

| general  |  |                   |
|----------|--|-------------------|
| Locative |  | <i>wanjabu</i>    |
|          |  | ( <i>wanja</i> )  |
| Ablative |  | <i>wanjamuny</i>  |
| Abessive |  | <i>wanjamundu</i> |

Table 3.1 1: The forms of wanja 'where'

As mentioned above, wanja(bu) can have both interrogative and indefinite meaning. Consider:

( 1 3 1) Yunu scissors wundi! Ngayku 2sg.POSS.ABS(O) scissors.ABS(O) take.IMP I sg.POSS.ABS(S) scissors wanjabu. scissors.ABS(S) somewhere 'Bring (take) your scissors ! My scissors are somewhere (1 don't know where I put them). '

More examples of the indefinite use of wanja forms can be found in text 51, lines 2 and 54, text 1 2, line 2.

Other interrogative roots are based on wanja, which invites the interpretation of wanja as 'general interrogative' root. Such forms are:

| wanjawanja  | 'when'      |
|-------------|-------------|
| wanjarr     | 'how'       |
| wanjarrinya | 'how many'  |
| wanjinya or | 'which one' |
| wanjaku     |             |

Wanjarr 'how' usually takes the adverbial suffix -ku (see §3.8.6.2), but may occur without it, especially with intransitive verbs, for example:

# 82 Chapter 3

- ( 1 32) Yundu wanjarr kada-ny-baja? 2sg.NOM(S) how come-PAST-again 'How did you come back?'
- ( 1 33) Yurra wanjarr(-ku) minya 2pl.NOM(A) how (-ADV) meat.ABS(O) 'How do you cook freshwater eel?' kubarr waju-l? freshwater .eel.ABS(O) cook -NONP AST

Wanjinya and wanjaku 'which one' seem to be freely interchangeable, for example:

( 1 34) Wanjinya/wanjaku yunu bayan? which. one 2sg,POSS.ABS house.ABS 'Which one is your house?'

A stem-forming suffix -nguy can be used with either wanyu 'what' or wanja 'where, general interrogative' to imply 'what kind', for example:

| (135) | Kuyu                                                                | wanyunguy              | jana          | mani-ny?           |  |

### 3. 6.2 Historical notes

It appears that all interrogative forms in Kuku Yalanji can be traced back to a general monosyllabic interrogative pA root \*waNH- (see Dixon 1 980:374-378) and inflected forms of this root have been reinterpreted as disyllabic roots (cf. reinterpretation of singular pronouns, §3.5.3). Interestingly, Yalanji and Nyungkul have reinterpreted the form for 'who' in different ways. In Nyungkul the ergative form \*waNH-du seems to be the underlying form for wanju, whereas Yalanji has simply added vowel a to the original absolutive form, i.e. wanya, in the same way as Yidiny has reinterpreted this root (see Dixon 1 980:374-375). The interrogative wanyu 'what' may also have been derived from the historic ergative form with further reduction of the intermorphemic consonant cluster: NHd > nyj > ny (cf. wanhu 'who' in Guugu Yimidhirr, Haviland 1 979a:69). Wanja 'where' is presumably based on the pA locative form \*waNH-da. Note that -nj- in wanju and wanja are phonetically homorganic clusters according to the assimilation rule n-> nj / -j, but they are not phonemically homorganic, since the preceding vowel does not have a palatal offglide, e.g. wanjja and not wainyja. (For assimilation rules see §2.4.)

Kuku Yalanji interrogative pronouns resemble most closely those of Yidiny (see Dixon 1 977a:1 87). Guugu Yimidhirr 'who' and 'where' are also based on pA \*waNH, but 'what' uses the root ngaan- (Haviland 1 979a:69), which is found as the base for 'who' or 'what' in Warrgamay (Queensland), Ngiyambaa (New South Wales) and some Victorian and Western Desert languages among others (see Dixon 1 980:373). Djabugay, on the other hand, has monosyllabic interrogative forms with long final vowel which are cognate to the second syllables, i.e. not the pA roots, of the Yidiny and/or Kuku Yalanji forms (see Hale 1 976b:238; Patz 1 99 1 :277-278).

|         | Djabugay | Yidiny | Kuku Yalanji             |
|---------|----------|--------|--------------------------|
| 'who'   | dju:     | wanyju | wanju (Nyungkul dialect) |
| 'what'  | nyi:     | wanyi  | wanyu                    |
| 'where' | dja:     | wanyja | wanja                    |

That is to say that Djabugay has undergone more changes, reverting to monosyllabic roots based on the increment to the pA roots.

## 3.7 Demonstratives

Kuku Yalanji has two demonstrative pronouns and two demonstrative location words, all of which follow the distinction between 'thislhere' and 'that/there'. The forms of 'this' and 'here' differ in the Yalanji and Nyungkul dialects as shown in Table 3 . 1 2.

|              | Yalanji | Nyungkul |
|--------------|---------|----------|
| 'this/these' | yanyu   | yanya    |
| 'that/those' | yinya   | yinya    |
| 'here'       | yaluy   | yalay    |
| 'there'      | yinyay  | yinyay   |

Table 3.12: Demonstratives in Yalanji and Nyungkul

Demonstrative pronouns imply singular or plural according to context, and may refer to animate or inanimate beings. They have the same case-marking possibilities as nomina Is , whereas demonstrative location words occur only in local cases. The paradigm of inflected forms and possessive and comitative stems in Table 3. 13 shows that demonstrative pronouns have suppletive bases for all inflected forms and stems which are either identical to the local demonstrative forms, e.g. in the dative forms and Nyungkul yalaymba 'this-LOC/POSS', or have dropped the final y of the local demonstratives as in the other forms. (Note that the same possessive suffix is used that occurs with interrogatives and some kinship terms.) The Yalanji forms for 'this' also show variation in the second base voweL In the ablative, abessive and comitative forms this is a, whereas all other forms have second vowel u. In the Yalanji dialect the 'neutral' locative form of 'this', yaluymbu, is often rejected and preference given to the corresponding local demonstrative, yaluy.

| POSS +<br>non-zero<br>inflection | yaluyundumun- | yalayandamun- | yinyandamun-         |

Table 3.13: Paradigm of demonstrative pronouns

Yinya 'that' and the suppletive forms of 'this' can form plural demonstrative pronouns with suffix -rriny (cf. suppletive root wanyurri(y)- 'what' in §3 .6. 1 ). These forms are used only in reference to human beings and apparently can only occur in absolutive case. They are:

|                | Yalanji    | Nyungkul   |
|----------------|------------|------------|
| 'these people' | yalurriny  | yalarriny  |
| 'those people' | yinyarriny | yinyarriny |

The paradigm of local demonstratives in Table 3.14 shows further similarities with the inflected forms of demonstrative pronouns. It can be seen from this table that the Yalanji demonstrative 'here' behaves exactly like location words. While the uninflected root implies general locative, the ablative and abessive forms show regular inflections. For 'there' and Nyungkul 'here', on the other hand, either the root or an inflected locative form may be used. (In Nyungkul the inflected form yalaymba is preferred.) The perlative forms in the Nyungkul dialect show an idiosyncratic suffix -ngkarr which does not occur with nominals. The ablative and abessive forms for 'there' and Nyungkul 'here' are identical to the corresponding demonstrative pronoun forms.

|       | 'here'     |            | 'there'                |
|-------|------------|------------|------------------------|
|       | Yalanji    | Nyungkul   |                        |
| LOC   | yaluy      | (yalay)    | yinyay                 |
|       |            | yalaymba   | yinyaymba              |
| ABL   | yaluymuny  | yalamuny   | yinyamuny              |
| ABESS | yaluymundu | yalamundu  | yinyamundu             |
| PERL  | yalangkarr | yalangkarr | yinyangkarr (Nyungkul) |

Table 3.14: Paradigm of local demonstratives

The conclusion that may be drawn from these morphological details is that there is no clear distinction between demonstrative pronouns and local demonstratives in the inflected forms.

Both Guugu Yimidhirr and Djabugay have demonstrative systems that do not distinguish between pronominal reference and local reference (Haviland 1 979a:72-74; Patz 1 99 1 :273ff.). In Djabugay demonstratives 'thislhere' and 'that/there' show singular/plural distinction in their root forms and function as third person singular and plural pronouns.

'Here' and 'there' in Kuku Yalanji may combine with the stem-forming suffix -arra 'inhabitants' :

| Yalanji  | yaluyarra  | 'the people of this place' |
|----------|------------|----------------------------|
| Nyungkul | yalayarra  |                            |
|          | yinyayarra | 'the people of that place' |

Although demonstrative pronouns and local demonstratives are not always different in form, they are distinct in function. Demonstrative pronouns, similar to personal pronouns, can replace or co-occur with a noun, for example:

| (138) | Yalu-ngku<br>jalbu-ngku                  | nganya     | binal-bunga-ny |
|-------|------------------------------------------|------------|----------------|
|       | this-ERG:pt(A) woman-ERG:pt(A)           | 1sg.ACC(O) | know-CAUS-PAST |
|       | marra-ka.                                |            |                |
|       | Zamia.nut-DAT                            |            |                |
|       | 'This woman taught me about zamia nuts.' |            |                |

- ( 1 39) Jana nubi-I-nubi-ny yinyay-anka karrkay-anka. 3pl.NOM(S) search-REDUP-PAST that-DAT:pt child-DAT:pt 'They were searching for that child.'
- (1 40) Yinyay-anda kaban daya. that-Loc:pt letter.ABS(O) give.lMP 'Give the letter to that [person].'

Local demonstratives, on the other hand, are not part of a wider noun phrase but occur on their own, for example:

(141) Nyulu yaluy-muny wanarri-y. 3sg.NOM(S) here-ABL run.REDUP-NONPAST 'He is running from here. '

### 86 Chapter 3

(1 42) Ngayu jarruka wubul warrmba-bunga-ny I sg.NOM(A) scrubhen.ABS(O) many.ABS(O) uncovered-CAUS-PAST yinyay-mba. there-LOC 'I found a lot of scrubhen [eggs] there. '

Sentences like 'he sat on that rock' are paraphrased as

(143) Nyulu yinyay-mba bundanda-ny, 3sg.NOM(S) there-LOC sit.REDUP-PAST 'He sat there, on the rock.' kulji-nga. rock-LOC

where kuljinga is clearly offset from the clause by a pause and falling intonation on the verb bundandany; that is, kuljinga could be regarded as outside the main clause. (Yinyaymba kuljinga as one phrase is possible, but the construction in ( 143) is preferred.)

## 3.8 Morphology of verbs

#### 3.8. 1 Introduction

Kuku Yalanji has only a rather small corpus of unanalysable verb roots (170 of a word list of 1 340 roots), but there are many verbal compounds in which some of these roots appear as second member. Furthermore, causative and inchoative derivational processes, which form verb stems from either nominal or verbal roots, are very productive indeed. This feature of a small verb root corpus, in which Kuku Yalanji resembles its northern neighbour Guugu Yimidhirr, is quite unusual for an eastern Australian language, but is widespread in languages of the West.

Kuku Yalanji verb roots refer almost exclusively to 'observable' actions, that is actions that can be seen or heard such as hit, eat, run, speak, call out, etc. Only very few abstract concepts are expressed by verb roots, e.g. nyuyal 'blame', bayjal 'ignore', while many others can be expressed through verbal derivations, e.g. wawurrwawurr-ma-l 'decide, be happy (lit: breathlspirit-COMIT-INCHO)'; see §3.9.1 (a) for information on this stem); through compounds, e.g. milka-jana-y 'listen (lit: ear-stand)" milka-wula-y 'forget (lit. ear-die)'; or through other paraphrases, e.g. milka-bu bayka-l 'think (lit. bite with ear)'. Detailed semantic differentiation accounts for a considerable number of roots, as for instance in the semantic field of 'movement along a path': yimba-l 'go straight through', warrki-l 'turn off at crossroads', barrma-l 'accompany someone for a short distance', nyunba-y 'turn back'.

### 3.8.2 Verbal word structure

#### 3.8.2. 1 General

Kuku Yalanji verb roots are typically disyllabic. There is a small proportion of trisyllabic roots which will be discussed in the next subsection. There are also four roots with four syllables which are presumably derivations or compounds historically, but which cannot be analysed. These are:

| jakalamba-l | 'gather firewood, set up fire'      |
|-------------|-------------------------------------|
| wubulamba-l | 'collect, gather' (< wubul 'many'?) |
| wukaramba-l | 'repair'                            |
| karangaji-y | 'sneak up, stalk'                   |

All verb roots can be recognised to end in a vowel, followed by a conjugation marker, which corresponds to the non-past tense inflection. This conjugation marker is deleted when inflections or stem-forming suffixes are added.

Final-root vowels are a and i with only one occurrence of final u in waju-l 'cook, burn' which has a cognate in Yidiny: wadu-l. The occurrence rate of final a is almost 20% higher than that of final i.

A verb root or compound stem always occurs with an inflectional suffix and can take up to two derivational suffixes between root or stem and inflection. Up to three enclitics may follow the inflected form.

Reduplication normally affects the whole root; only a small number of verbs show partial reduplication of either the first or the second syllable. When a root is reduplicated as a whole the two parts are linked by a filler morpheme whose form depends on the conjugation class of the root or, if a derivational suffix is added, on the conjugation class of the derived stem. In compound stems it is only the second member which is reduplicated.

## 3.8.2.2 Trisyllabic roots

There are 28 trisyllabic roots, which may be divided into four groups according to their last syllable: -rri, -ma, -ba and others. Some verbs are included in this group which are likely to be regularly formed derivations whose roots have ceased to function independently in Kuku Yalanji. (Inseparable reflexive and reciprocal stems do not fall into this category; they are discussed in their respective sub-sections.) All trisyllabic roots but one belong to the lconjugation class but transitivity varies, although the majority is transitive.

## (i) Final syllable -rri

There are 18 attested roots in this group, some of which have cognates among the r-conjugation verbs in Guugu Yimidhirr. These roots have been formed through a reinterpretation process outlined in §3.8.3.2 (ii).

At least three of the roots that do not have cognates among the r-conjugation verbs in Guugu Yirnidhirr seem to be based directly on a nominal root. These are:

| bijarri-l    | 'to dream'         | bijarr                                                   | 'dream'            |
|--------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| ngangkurri-l | 'to bark'          | ngangkurr                                                | 'sound of barking' |
| nganjarri-l  | 'not know someone' | (Guugu Yimidhirr nganhdha-<br>nganhdha 'foreign person') |                    |

## (ii) Final syllable -ma

The three verbs ill this group are possibly formed with the inchoative suffix -ma-l. They are:

| jalama-l  | "jump"                                                  |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| jirayma-l | "long for, crave" (cf. Djabugay jiran "thirst, hunger") |
| yalama-l  | "say, do"                                               |

The first two are intransitive, which corresponds to the transitivity class of inchoative stems; but yalama-l 'say, do', which may possibly be based on the suppletive demonstrative form yala 'this', is a transitive verb. 13

## (iii) Final syllable -ba

Kadaba-l 'break (itr)" and possibly also three of the four roots with four syllables listed in the previous subsection belong to this group. The three roots with four syllables are all transitive, and final -ba may be a regular reduction of causative -bunga-l (see §3.8.5.1 (i» , e.g. wubulamba-l 'gather' could be analysed as wubul 'many' + causative. However, the cluster mb at the assumed morpheme boundary is quite unexplainable. The intransitive verb kadaba-l has an identical cognate in Guugu Yirnidhirr where Haviland ( 1 979a:80) interprets the final -bal as a nonproductive verbaliser.

(iv) The remaining trisyllabic roots are quite opaque, although they show some similarities in their final syllables:

| buraka-l   | 'hang up to dry (tr)'         |
|------------|-------------------------------|
| yiringka-l | 'drag (tr)'                   |
| buyandi-l  | 'put in container (tr)'       |
| dakandi-l  | 'knock down (tr)'             |
| kalkandi-l | 'tighten up, wedge in (tr)    |
| warringa-l | 'keep under observation (tr)' |

### 3.B.3 Transitivity and conjugations

#### 3.8.3. 1 Correlation of transitivity and conjugation

As in other Australian languages there is a strict division between transItive and intransitive verbs in Kuku Yalanji. The most basic criterion for distinguishing these grammatical classes is the case inflection on the subject noun occurring with a verb: only a transitive verb can co-occur with a noun in Ergative case while an intransitive verb requires a subject noun in Absolutive case.

Of the 1 70 verb roots in Kuku Yalanji 1 32 (77.6%) are transitive and 38 (22.4%) are intransitive. Six fixed reflexive and two reciprocal stems can be added to the latter group. These stems, although analysable, show considerable extension of the semantic content of the root component and are therefore best regarded as independent lexemes but not necessarily as roots (see §3.8.5.4 (i) and (ii» .

<sup>13</sup> Compare Dyirbal yala 'this', yalama-l 'do like this, say, tell'. Similar verb forms 'do/say like this/that' exist in many other Australian languages as well as in Central Australian Creole: lakijat < 'like that' (Koch, pers. cornm.).

Formally, Kuku Yalanji verbs are divided into two open conjugation classes, i-conjugation and y-conjugation, according to the conjugation marker -l or -y that is suffixed to a root in what I interpret as the citation form. Apart from this citation form which coincides with the non-past form of a verb the two conjugations differ only in their imperative inflection on disyllabic roots and in their reduplicated forms.

There is an obvious correlation between grammatical class and formal class: y-conjugation verbs are exclusively intransitive while i-conjugation verbs are 92% transitive. The number of known intransitive i-conjugation roots is so small that they may be listed in full:

| daka-l    | 'climb, rise'            |
|-----------|--------------------------|
| janji-l   | 'swim, bathe'            |
| kalji-l   | 'vomit'                  |
| wala-l    | 'enter'                  |
| walngka-l | 'hang'                   |
| wandi-l   | 'come out, wake up'      |
| warrki-l  | 'turn off at crossroads' |
| wurrka-l  | 'ache' (Nyungkul)        |
| kadaba-l  | 'break'                  |
| jalama-l  | 'jump'                   |
| jirayma-l | 'crave, long for'        |

Since the very productively used inchoative verbaliser ma-i belongs to the i-conjugation the overall transitivity proportion of i-conjugation verbs is quite different from that among i-conjugation roots, i.e. the share of intransitive verbs among all i-conjugation verbs is much higher than that among roots only.

A similar proportion of a- and i-final roots is found in both conjugations. Statistical correlation between conjugation, transitivity and final root vowels are shown in Table 3.15.

### 3.8.3.2 Development of Kuku Yalanji conjugations

With two open conjugation classes Kuku Yalanji has developed one of the least complex conjugation systems found in Australia. The fact that the two conjugations differ only in two inflections and in reduplicated forms indicates that only minor further simplification will lead to the complete abolition of distinct conjugation classes, a process which has already been completed in some Central Australian languages, as for instance Arandic (Koch, pers. comm.). Languages of the Queensland coastal rainforest region to the South of Kuku Yalanji have simplified their conjugation systems in similar ways. Djabugay (patz 1 99 1 :278ff.) and Dyirbal (Dixon 1 972:54ff.) each have open y- and l-conjugations, but differences between these classes are more distinct than in Kuku Yalanji. Yidiny, located between Djabugay and Dyirbal, has the same open classes plus a small group of rconjugation verbs (Dixon 1 977a:206ff.). Guugu Yirnidhirr (Haviland 1 979a:78ff.), on the other hand, has retained a system of five conjugations and can therefore be considered the most conservative of the languages mentioned above.14 Conjugations in Guugu Yimidhirr are: L- and R-conjugations (both open classes), V-, MA- and NA- conjugations (closed classes with very few members). A comparison of unusual root forms in Kuku Yalanji, i.e. suppletive roots and some trisyllabic forms, with cognates in Guugu Yimidhirr provides some information on how conjugations have contracted in Kuku Yalanji.

## (i) Suppletive roots

Three l-conjugation verbs in Kuku Yalanji have suppletive roots that are used as imperative forms; these are:

|        | Non-past | Imperative |
|--------|----------|------------|
| 'see'  | nyaji-l  | nyaka      |
| 'get'  | mani-l   | mana       |
| 'give' | daji-l   | daya       |

Nyajil and manil have monosyllabic cognates in Guugu Yirnidhirr MA- and NAconjugations respectively. Listed below are the Guugu Yimidhirr roots with their past tense forms and disyllabic stems that have to be used with purposive inflection:

|       | Root  | PAST     | Stem + PURP  |
|-------|-------|----------|--------------|
| 'see' | nhaa- | nhaa-dhi | nhaa-dhi-nhu |
| 'get' | maa-  | maa-ni   | maa-ni-nhu   |

The disyllabic stems which have the same form as root + PAST are easily recognisable as the Kuku Yalanji roots:

| Guugu Yimidhirr | nhaa-dhi > | Kuku Yalanji | nyaji- |
|-----------------|------------|--------------|--------|
|                 | maa-ni- >  |              | mani-  |

Both transitive roots were reassigned in Kuku Yalanji to the predominantly transitive I-conjugation. (Vowel-length contrast has been lost in Kuku Yalanji.)

The imperative form nyaka 'see!' can be analysed as a mono-syllabic root plus pA imperative suffix \*-ga (see Dixon 1 980:4 1 0). (Note that Kuku Yalanji also uses imperative inflection -ka with roots and stems of more than two syllables.) Ngawaygi, a Queensland language further south, has the cognate form nyaa-ga 'see!', and also maa-na 'hold in hand!', cognate with Kuku Yalanji imperative mana 'get!' (Dixon 1 980:399).

<sup>14</sup> Nyawaygi, next but one to the South of Dyirbal, has seven conjugations and many similarities to Guugu Yirnidhirr (Dixon 1 980:397).
