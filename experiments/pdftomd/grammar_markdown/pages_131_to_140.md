Adverbial suffix -ku may be attached to inflected nouns to form adverbials of time, for example:

(202) N gayu warru-ku Palm Island bundanda-ny. I sg.NOM(S) yg.man.ABS-ADV Palm.lsland sit.REDUP-PAST 'As a young man I stayed at Palm Island.'

(203) N gayu karrkay-nyja-ku minya kadar I sg.NOM(A) child-ERG-ADV meat.ABS(O) wallaby.ABS(O) ngangkin nuka-l-nuka-ny. porcupine.ABS(O) eat-l-REDUP-PAST 'As a child I used to eat wallaby and porcupine.'

However, it is possible, that -ku in this context is not the adverb-forming suffix but the homophonous emphatic clitic -ku. The latter could be interpreted as highlighting the temporal contrast implied in these sentences, e.g. 'As a young man (which I am no longer) I stayed at Palm Island'. Compare R. Hershberger's ( 1 979:55) attested 'adverbial' suffix -ku with an inflected nominal form:

(204) Dingkar-angka nyunguniny yarkin-ka-ku kuni-ny. man-ERG:pt(A) 3sg.ACC(O) corpse-DAT-ADV(?) hitJkill-PAST "The man murdered him (intended to kill)." (translation from R. Hershberger)

Again, -ku could be interpreted as either adverbial suffix, 'He hit/injured him deadly', or as emphatic clitic, 'He hit him quite dead'.

## 3.9 Free-form particles

Apart from the adverbial particles discussed in §3.8.6.1 above, Kuku Yalanji employs a number of non-inflected free-form particles in various functions at clause and sentence level. We can distinguish four groups: adjectival, comparison, negation and discourse particles.

## 3.9. 1 Adjectival particles

There are four adjectival particles:

| binal  | 'know (about) something' |
|--------|--------------------------|
| juburr | 'be good at something'   |
| yinil  | 'be afraid'              |
| wawu   | 'want, like'             |

All of these are used in predicator function with a dative noun or purposive verb as complement (see §4.9. 1 ). The reasons for classification as adjectival rather than verbal particles are as follows:

(a) All these particles may form causative and inchoative verb stems with -bunga-l and -ma-l (see §3.8.5.1 and §3.8.5.3), which are used to verbalise nominals:

| yinil-bungal | 'frighten someone'20      |
|--------------|---------------------------|
| binal-mal    | 'learn [about] something' |

Verb stems derived from wawu 'want, like' show a vestige of a comitative suffix (see §3.2.3.3) and have somewhat extended semantic content:

| wawurrwawurr-mal    | 'be happy; decide' |
|---------------------|--------------------|
| wawurrwawurr-bungal | 'make happy'       |

Wawu is also a noun meaning 'breath, spirit, soul'. Note that the cognate noun in Guugu Yimidhirr with the same meaning must take comitative to express 'want, like'.

- (b) All these particles, except for juburr, form privative stems (see §3.2.3.4), e.g. wawukari 'don't want, don't like'. (possibly the privative form of juburr 'good at' is not used because there is a lexical alternative: manjarr 'no good at, lazy'.)
- (c) These particles, except for wawu, may take the degree suffix -bajaku (see §3.2.3 .8) which places them in the adjective rather than in the noun category. But note that these particles do not take case inflections and can therefore not be regarded as 'proper' adjectives.

juburr-bajaku 'be very good at' binal-bajaku 'know very much, know exactly'

(To intensify wawu the quantifier jirray is used: wawu jirray 'like a lot, love'.)

## 3.9.2 Comparison, negation and discourse particles

These particles, in contrast to those discussed in the previous subsection, have no regular derivational possibilities. Only some isolated lexical items have one or the other of these particles as their basis. The functions of the particles listed below are described in following chapters as indicated.

(i) Comparison particle

Particle yala '(be) like, (be) the same' (glossed as COMP) may be related to the suppletive demonstrative root yala 'this'. The syntactic function of particle yala is discussed in §4.9.3. When used in reference to appearance this particle co-occurs with walu 'face' in either order, for example:

(205) Nyulu yala walulwalu yala bikibiki. 'He looks like a pig.'

Yala may also take the emphatic clitic -rrku (see §3. 1 0.2): yalarrku 'just the same; also', for example:

(206) Kanbal bubu yala-rrku. some.ABS(S) place.ABS(S) COMP-EMPH4 'Some places are just the same [as this place]. '

<sup>20</sup> Yinil 'be afraid' is used in free variation with a comitative form yinil-ji or yini-ji which, however, may not be verbalised.

# (207) Wulman yala-rrku manyarr-anka badi-ny. old.man.ABs(S) COMP-EMPH4 wife-DAT:pt cry-PAST 'The old man also cried for his wife [just like the others].'

### (ii) Negation particles

These particles include kari 'not' (NEG) and balu 'desist, give up' (NEG2)' Particle kari may take clitics -ku 'general emphasis' and -rrku 'totality' (see §3.10.2). Kariku has emphatic or temporal meaning according to context, that is 'not all' or 'not yet'. Karirrku implies 'not really, not altogether', for example:

(208) N gayu kari-rrku warngku-wuna-ny. 1 sg.NOM(S) NEG-EMPH4 sleep-lie-PAST 'I did not really sleep (I just dozed).'

(The functions of *kari* as negation particle are discussed in §4.9.3.)

*Balu* may take clitic -*da*, actually a temporal clitic (see §3.10.1), but *baluda* is used in the sense of 'let it be, don't do what you are about to do'. The use of balu as negation particle is discussed in §4.9.2.

#### (iii) Discourse particles

Kari and balu may be used not only in reference to part of a clause, for instance the predicate, but also to modify a whole clause and as such have additional function as discourse particles. In discourse function these particles are placed in clause-initial position; in direct negation function they occur adjacent to the clause constituent that they negate. The full inventory of discourse particles is:

| kari                      |  | 'a contrasting event' (gloss 'but') (see §5.5.3)         |
|---------------------------|--|----------------------------------------------------------|
| yamba/yambada/yambala     |  | 'a contrasting state' (gloss 'but')                      |
| kaki                      |  | 'when, if'                                               |
| kunka                     |  | 'in case' (specified hypothetical event)                 |
| nganganjirrka/nganganjida |  | 'in case' (not necessarily specified hypothetical event) |
| balu                      |  | 'wrong assumption' (gloss 'wrong')21                     |
| nguba                     |  | 'maybe, perhaps'                                         |

(Like glosses of other discourse particles, e.g. *kunka* 'in case', glosses for *kari* and *balu* in discourse function are represented by appropriate English lexical items, rather than by abstract terms, to distinguish their discourse function from their negation function.)

*Kari, yamba, kaki, kunka* and *nganganjirrka* function as co-ordination particles, although ngangnanjirrka may also occur independently outside a clausal context, and are explained in §4.3.2. For syntactic behaviour of balu and nguba see §4.9.2 and §4.9.3 respectively.

<sup>21</sup> A similar 'mistaken thought' particle can be found in the Western Desert language Ngaanyatjarra (Glass 1 980).

## 3.10 Clitics

There are several bound morphemes in Kuku Yalanji which always occur word-finally, i.e. after roots, stems or inflected forms. They may be categorised as enclitics rather than post-inflectional suffixes, because (a) they cannot be stressed, and (b) their co-occurrence is not confined to particular parts of speech, but they may attach to a variety of host words.22 Kuku Yalanji enclitics are grouped below according to their function, including descriptions of their use and/or reference to following sections where their functions are discussed more fully.

## 3. 10.1 Temporal clitics

| -da                | 'then' (following action or state)23 (TEMP1)       |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| -ku                | 'before' (preceding action or state)               |
| -kuda              | 'meanwhile' (?) (TEMP2)                            |
| -ngVrr/V ~ -Vrr/C- | 'first of all' (TEMP3)                             |
| wawu-              | 'since, after' in connection with Ablative (TEMP4) |

Clitic -*da* is most frequently used with verbs, but has also been attested with all other parts of speech. It typically occurs on the last of a sequence of verbs to indicate that this is the final in a sequence of actions, for example:

(209) *Jana kada-ny, kuyu mani-ny, waju-ny, nuka-ny-da*. 3pl.NOM(S) come-PAST fish.ABS(O) get-PAST cook-PAST eat-PAST-TEMP1 'They came, caught a fish, cooked [it], and then ate [it].'

(For discourse function of clitic -*da* in temporal cohesion see §5.2.2; for use with imperatives see §4.7.)

The semantic content of clitic -*ku* is sometimes ambiguous and a distinction between temporal and emphatic -*ku* (see §3.10.2 below) is often impossible. (Note that -*ku* also functions as adverb marker and is homophonous with one allomorph of dative inflection (see §3.2.2).) Only in two time words does -*ku* clearly have a reference to times past, i.e. *ngadiku* 'a long time ago' and yilayku 'yesterday'. But while only some occurrences in discourse may be interpreted as having temporal reference, an interpretation as emphatic clitic is always possible. For this reason, and also because the cognate post-inflectional suffix -:*gu* in Guugu Yirnidhirr has clearly emphatic function (Haviland 1 979a:60), I favour this interpretation of -*ku* as emphatic marker.

Clitic -*kuda*, which is used mostly with verbs but also with nominals and pronouns, is not easily definable. Its most plausible interpretation as 'meanwhile' is explained in §5.2.2.24 If -*ku* is, or was, a temporal clitic meaning 'before', a combination of -*ku* + -*da* 'before then'

<sup>22</sup> J.L. Klavans (1980) uses the term "host" for the word to which a clitic is attached.

<sup>23</sup> R. Hershberger (1964d) uses glosses -*ku* 'then' and -*da* 'now' in reference to a “prior time” and “now or following" time respectively. While on the whole my observations agree with hers, the status of -ku as temporal or emphatic clitic is ambiguous, as will be shown in this and the following section. See also H. Hershberger and R. Hershberger ( 1 982:294) "ku shows emphasis".

<sup>24</sup> R. Hershberger (1979:72 and 74) attested *kuda* as a free-form particle functioning as clause-initial question marker. I have heard this in conversation, but in elicitation this use of *kuda* was treated with misgivings.

may perhaps refer to a time span outside or 'alongside' this temporal symmetry, i.e. 'meanwhile'. 

Clitic -(*ng*)*Vrr* 'first of all' has been attested with verbs, nouns and pronouns. It indicated either that a certain action is (or has to be) the first in a sequence, or that the referent is the first to do it, or the first to be affected, e.g. *duda-ny-arr* 'pounded [it] first, then ...' *wulmanangka-ngarr* 'old man(ERG) was the first to ...'. 

(210) *Nyulu kuyu-ngurr mani-ny, ngawuya dama-ny-da*. 3sg.NOM(A) fish.ABS(O)-TEMP3 get-PAST turtle.ABs(o) spear-PAST-TEMPI 'He caught a fish first, then speared a turtle.' 

With suppletive imperative forms and with trisyllabic roots with imperative inflection this clitic has also been attested as simply -rr, e.g. daya-rr 'give it first', julurri-ka-rr 'wash it first'. (For a full discussion of the discourse use of -(ng)*Vrr* see [§5.2.2](#page-10-0); for use with imperatives see §4.7.) 

Proclitic *wawu-* occurs only with ablative forms, the whole word meaning 'since, after X', e.g.wawu-yinya-muny 'after that', wawu-mayi-muny 'after the meal'. 

## 3.10.2 Emphatic clitics

| -ku                          | general emphasis: 'really' (?) (EMPH 1) |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| -lu (Yalanji)/-la (Nyungkul) | 'pay attention' (EMPH2)                 |
| -bi                          | surprise: 'lo and behold' (EMPH3)       |

Clitic -*ku* is used copiously in discourse with all parts of speech and is used as a 'general emphasis' marker. English translations may resort to 'really' for -*ku*, e.g. *yalbay-ku* 'really big', *jalbu-ku* '(it was) really the woman' and *wubul-ku* 'really a lot', but in most cases this would be too strong, particularly since 'really' also implies 'high degree'. 

*Yalanji -lu* and *Nyungkul -la* are attention-getting devices in discourse (see [§5.4.2](#page-10-0)) and may attach to all parts of speech. Clitic -*lu* in *Yalanji* marks especially important events by particularly frequent occurrence in limited stretches of discourse (see [§5.5.1.1](#page-10-0)).

Clitic -*bi*, which also occurs with all parts of speech, conveys an element of surprise, similar to -*bi* in Djabugay, which is even stressed (Patz 1991:286). For details of its use see §5.4.2. 

Clitic -*rrku*/*V*- ~ *Vrrku*/*C*- 'totality, exclusive' (EMPH4) may also be grouped among emphatic clitics (note its ending -*ku*), but it has more restricted application than the others. It is only used with verbs, pronouns, and particles *kari* 'not' and *yala* 'like, same'. With verbs -(*V*)*rrku* implies that an action is carried out totally and thoroughly, for example: 

- (211) *Maral-angka kambijulurri-ny-arrku*. girl-ERG:pt(A) clothes.ABS(O) wash-PAST-EMPH4 'The girl washed all the clothes thoroughly.'
- (21) 2) Bayan kida-rrku! house.ABS(O) sweep.IMP-EMPH4 'Sweep the whole house thoroughly!'

With pronouns -(V)rrku stresses that only the particular referent is involved, for example:

# 1 1 6 Chapter 3

- (2 1 3) Ngayu wawu balka-nka yunu-ndu-rrku. 1 sg.NOM(S) want speak-PURP 2sg-LOC-EMPH4 'I want to speak only to you.'
- (2 1 4) Bama mungka-dunju nyulu-rrku kudamundu person.ABS(S) hair-curly.ABS(S) 3sg.NOM(S)-EMPH4 afterwards

jiba-badi-ny.

feel sorry-PAST

'Only the Islander felt sorry afterwards.' (Many years ago two whites and a Torres Strait Islander ('curly hair') had assaulted and robbed a settler in the area.)

(2 1 5) Ngayu-rrku bundanda-y. 1 sg.NOM(S)-EMPH4 sit.REDUP-NONPAST 'I am living by myself.'

## 3. 10.3 Other clitics

Clitic -baja 'very/again' has dual function as a stem-forming suffix with adjectives (see §3.2.3.8 (ii)) and a post-inflectional clitic with verbs. When attached to adjectives -baja always occurs in conjunction with emphatic clitic -*ku*, meaning 'very adjective'. On verbs -baja can apparently not be followed by -ku.

With state verbs, as with adjectives, -baja expresses a fairly high degree of intensity, as in yinilmanybaja 'were quite scared' in text 3, line 43, or:

(2 1 6) Nyulu bambay-ma-l-baja. 3sg.NOM(S) sick-INCHO-NONPAST-DEGREE 'He is getting quite sick. '

With action and motion verbs, on the other hand, -baja means 'verb again' (and will be glossed as 'again' in this context), for example:

- (2 1 7) Bajabaja-ngka jinkalmu bayka-ny-baja. blue.tongue.lizard-ERG:pt(A) taipan.ABs(o) bite-PAST -again 'The blue tongue lizard bit the taipan again.' (Blue tongue lizards are said to be able to fight and kill taipans.)
- (2 1 8) N gayu wawu kada-nka-baja. 1 sg.NOM(S) want come-PURP-again 'I want to come back.'

An idiomatic use of -baja has to be noted: yundu-ku-baja 'it's up to you'.

Clitic -*ji* (*Yalanji*), -*yijin* (*Nyungkul*)<sup>25</sup> attaches only to pronouns and expresses 'X's turn, X does something in turn' which may or may not imply an obligation to perform a particular action, for example:

| (219) | Ngayu      | yunu     | mani         | daji-l,      |
|-------|------------|----------|--------------|--------------|
|       | 1sg.NOM(A) | 2sg.POSS | money.ABS(O) | give-NONPAST |

<sup>25</sup>H. Hershberger and R. Hershberger ( 1 982) record the NyungkuI form of this clitic as -jilin.

yundu-ji ngayku mznya daya. 2sg.NOM(A)-in.tum I sg.POSS meat.ABS(O) give.IMP 'I give you money and you, in tum, give me meat. ' (fhis refers to an exchange of favours rather than a business transaction.)

(220) Monday yindu ngayu-ji school-mun-bu dunga-ny, Monday other I sg.NOM(S)-in tum school-mun-LOC go-PAST mayi waju-nku. food.ABS(O) cook-PURP

'Last Monday it was my tum to go to the school to cook food [i.e. school lunch].'

(22 1) Yundu-ji bunda-y, ngayu bubu kida-l. 2sg.NOM(S)-in tum sit-IMP I sg.NOM(A) ground.ABS(O) sweep-NONPAST 'It's your tum to sit down, I sweep the yard.' (lit. ground)

## 3. 10.4 Ordering of clitics

Clitics may co-occur in the order:

temporal clitic

- emphatic clitics EMPHl-3

-ji 'in turn'

The forms -baja as verbal clitic and -(V)rrku EMPH4 have not been attested in conjunction with other clitics. The three temporal clitics cannot co-occur, but emphatic clitics EMPHl-3 may be used together in the numerical order of the subscript: -ku (EMPHl) -lu (EMPH2) -bi (EMPH3)·

### 3.11 Interjections

Kuku Yalanji has four monosyllabic and seven polysyllabic interjections, which cannot take any affixes and make up a distinct intonation group. A list of these with a description of their functions is given in §4. 1 0.

## 3.12 Morphological adaptation of English loan words

English noun roots with any number of syllables usually take catalytic suffix -mun- before inflections or stem-forming suffixes, e.g. car-mun-du (LOC), school-mun-ku (DAT), motorbike-mun-ji (COMIT). However, the catalytic suffix is not obligatory and English loans have often been attested without it, e.g. toyota-nga (LOC) (text 3, line 4), Chrisangka (ERG:pt) (text 3, line 1 5), car-nga (LOC).

English adjectives are suffixed with -bala , which is a feature in Pidgin (< 'fellow' as in waybala 'white fellow, white man'), e.g. drunk-bala, brown-bala, busy-bala-baja-ku 'very busy'.

Like many other Australian languages, Kuku Yalanji borrows English verbs as nominal roots which are then verbalised by inchoative or causative derivations. Intransitive verbs take the inchoative verbaliser -ma-l. If the root is monosyllabic, the inchoative suffix is usually

## 118 Chapter 3

reduplicated, e.g. travel-ma-l, shift-ma-I-ma-l. Note that the verb 'work' often takes the causative suffix -mani-l, used with intransitive verbs (see §3.8.5. 1 ), but in passivised form with suffix -ji-, e.g. ngayu work-ma-n-mani-ji-ny 'I worked (lit: I was made to work)'. Transitive verb roots are suffixed with -im<sup>26</sup> before combining with the transitive verbaliser -bunga-l ~ -ba-l, for instance: fix-im-bunga-l (fix-im-ba-l), push-im-bunga-l, count-imbunga-l, polish-im-bunga-l. (Note that only -bunga-l, and not -kanga-l, is used with English verbs.)

<sup>26</sup>This suffix, presumably < 'him' as in 'fix him' is widely used in Australian pidgins and creoles (see Crowley & Rigsby 1 979).

# 4 Syntax

## 4.1 Simple sentences

A simple sentence in Kuku Yalanji normally consists of a verb complex (ve) and one or more noun phrases (NP) which fulfil particular syntactic and semantic functions in relation to the verb. But in the absence of copulas in Kuku Yalanji we have to distinguish between such verbal sentences and verbless or nominal sentences in which the verb slot remains unfilled.

To begin with, this section presents the possible constituents of noun phrases and of the verb complex, and their combinations. Sub-section §4.1 .3 discusses the syntactic types of verbs, followed by core-syntactic structures of simple sentences and optional extensions in §4. 1 .4. Nominal sentences are dealt with in §4. 1 .S and finally there are some remarks on the order of sentence constituents in §4.1 .6.

## 4. 1. 1 Noun phrases

A noun phrase in Kuku Yalanji may consist of several parts either in a continuous line or scattered in certain chunks throughout the sentence. All NP constituents have to agree in case marking whether the NP is continuous or discontinuous; only possessive constructions are exempt from this rule, in that case marking is not obligatory for the possessive form in a continuous NP (see §3.2.3.2 and §4.S.1). Continuous NPs where only the last constituent was marked for case have occasionally been encountered in discourse; however, when editing their own narratives, informants always corrected such occurrences to include case marking on all constituents.

A noun phrase may include the following constituents:

(a) A proper noun, for example:

| Mandu, Jinabaji, Mabel | (personal names) |
|------------------------|------------------|
| Wangkabaja, Bibikarrbi | (place names )   |

(b) A common specific noun, for example:

| maral   | 'girl'             |
|---------|--------------------|
| kalnga  | 'mother's brother' |
| kundurr | 'death adder'      |
| wada    | 'wild apple'       |

(c) A generic term (see §3 .1.2 (i)) on its own or preceding (b), for example:

| jarba          | 'snake'                |
|----------------|------------------------|
| mayi wukay     | 'plant food hairy yam' |
| minya ngangkin | 'flesh food porcupine' |
| juku buyku     | 'tree paperbark'       |

The use of generic nouns as a kind of classifier together with specific nouns is quite common in Yidiny and Guugu Yimidhirr. In Kuku Yalanji, on the other hand, the only generic terms that are used frequently in a classifying function are minya 'flesh food' (in contrast to inedible animals) and mayi 'plant food' (in contrast to inedible plants). Other generic terms have only occasionally been attested as classifiers in conjunction with specific nouns.

(d) A demonstrative pronoun (see §3.7) on its own or together with (b) or (c) or both, for example:

| yinya                       | 'that'                   |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------|
| yinya karrkay/karrkay yinya | 'that child'             |
| yanyu dikal (wakuka)        | 'this bird (kookaburra)' |

In combination with one noun the demonstrative may precede or follow the noun; ill combination with two nouns the demonstrative is preferred in initial position.

(e) An interrogative pronoun (see §3.6. 1) on its own or together with (b) or (c), for example:

| wanya       |  | 'who'             |
|-------------|--|-------------------|
| wanya warru |  | 'which young man' |
| wanyu minya |  | 'what meat'       |

(f) A personal pronoun (see §3.5. 1) on its own or followed by any of (a}-(d), for example:

| yundu          | 'you (sg)'         |
|----------------|--------------------|
| yubal Coraleen | 'you and Coraleen' |
| bula ngamu     | 'the two mothers'  |
| jana bama      | 'the Aborigines'   |
| nyulu yinya    | 'that one'         |

The anaphoric and/or definite reference of noun phrases of this type is discussed in §5.2.1 .1 and §5.2.1 .2.

(g) One or more modifiers such as adjectives, comitative or privative forms in attributive function and quantifiers may be optionally included in a noun phrase of type (b), (c), (d) or (f), for example:

| dubal murru-murru     | (bark rough)              | 'rough bark'              |
|-----------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| jambul kaya kuli-ji   | (two dog rage-COMIT)      | 'two vicious dogs'        |
| yinya yalbay junka-ji | (that big strength-COMIT) | 'that big and strong one' |
| nyulu kiru-kari       | (3sg brain-PRIV)          | 'the stupid one'          |

The preferred order is for the modifier to follow the head constituent, but where an adjective and a quantifier are used together the quantifier tends to precede and the adjective to follow the head. Combinations of two or even more descriptive adjectives are rare.
