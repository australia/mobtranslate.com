No cognates for Kuku Yalanji daji-l 'give' and its suppletive form daya have been determined so far. The development of this form therefore remains unclear.

Another cognate monosyllabic root in Guugu Yimidhirr NA-conjugation supports the pattern of reinterpretation of past tense form or disyllabic stem as root:

|       | Guugu Yimidhirr | Kuku Yalanji |              |
|-------|-----------------|--------------|--------------|
| Root  | wu-             | wuna-        | 'lie (down)' |
| PAST  | wu-nay          | wuna-ny      |              |
| 'PURP | wu-na-nhu       | wuna-nka     |              |

The reinterpreted intransitive root wuna- 'lie' has been reassigned in Kuku Yalanji to the exclusively intransitive y-conjugation. 15

# (ii) Trisyllabic roots with final syllable -rri

Six of the eighteen attested -rri-final trisyllabic roots in Kuku Yalanji have cognates among the transitive disyllabic members of the R-conjugation in Guugu Yimidhirr. These are:

| Kuku Yalanji |               | Guugu Yimidhirr |               |
|--------------|---------------|-----------------|---------------|
| janjarri-l   | 'investigate' | dhunhdha-rr     | 'ask for'     |
| julurri-l    | 'wash'        | dhulu-rr        | 'scrub, wash' |
| nyangarri-l  | 'pour out'    | nhiinggu-rr     | 'pour out'    |
| walngkurri-l | 'ask for'     | walnggu-rr      | 'ask for'     |
| wukurri-l    | 'follow'      | wuku-rr         | 'follow'      |
| yijarri-l    | 'put, place'  | yidha-rr        | 'put, place'  |

Older speakers in Guugu Yimidhirr use past tense inflection -rrinh with R-conjugation verbs (younger speakers use -rrin), e.g. wuku-rrinh 'followed', yidha-rrinh 'placed'. Apparently this past tense inflection has been reinterpreted as a third root syllable -rri- plus general past inflection -ny « -nh) in Kuku Yalanji (see Haviland 1 979a:87). According to their transitivity class the reinterpreted roots were incorporated into l-conjugation.16 Thus the new verb forms in Kuku Yalanji are:

|            | Citation form | PAST       |               |
|------------|---------------|------------|---------------|
| follow     | wukurri-l     | wukurri-ny |               |
| place, put | yijarri-l     | yijarri-ny | and so forth. |

Note that only R-conjugation verbs and monosyllabic roots in Guugu Yimidhirr show instances of final root vowel u. In the reinterpretation process outlined above final u ends up in penultimate vowel position which helps to explain why root-final u is extremely rare in Kuku Yalanji verbs.

<sup>15</sup> Haviland (1979a:85) reports that a similar process is taking place in Guugu Yimidhirr where "many younger speakers treat the NA-conjugation verb wu-naa 'lie down' as if it were a regular V-conjugation verb of the form wunaa."

<sup>16</sup> Note that Djabugay has a derivational suffix -*rri*- which transitivises intransitive verb roots, e.g. warrnki-y 'turn (itr)', warrnki-rri-l 'turn something (tr)' (Hale 1 976b:238; Patz 1 991 :283).

### 3.8.4 Verbal inflections

#### 3.8. 4. 1 Paradigm

Verbal inflections in Kuku Yalanji include a two-term tense system, nonpast and past, plus imperative, purposive, precautionary, successive, irrealis, and a suffix which has dual function as 'unmarked' inflection (in Nyungkul dialect) and subordination marker in both dialects. Except for nonpast and imperative on disyllabic roots inflectional suffixes are identical for both conjugations. Table 3. 16 shows the paradigm of verbal inflections, while Table 3.17 gives examples of inflected verbs. The latter includes a trisyllabic root to illustrate the imperative suffix that is used with roots or stems of more than two syllables of either conjugation.

### 3.8. 4.2 Functions of verbal inflections

The eight functions of the inflections listed above are as follows:

(i) NONPAST -I, -y

This inflection, which is identical to the conjugation marker, refers to an action or state in the present or future. To make reference to future explicit, a time word such as juma 'soonllater', wunkuny 'next day', etc. is added.

| (144) | Warru-ngku                             | baya            | nyanda-l.     |
|-------|----------------------------------------|-----------------|---------------|
|       | yg.man-ERG:pt(A)                       | firewood.ABS(O) | split-NONPAST |
|       | 'The young man is splitting firewood.' |                 |               |

(1 45) Jarramali juma kada-y. thunderstorm.ABS(S) soon come-NONPAST 'A thunderstorm will come soon.'

### (ii) PAST -ny

A verb with past tense inflection may have perfective or imperfective implication. It can usually be inferred from the context whether an action or state that began in the past has been completed or is still going on at the time of the utterance.

| (146) | Dingkar-angka                                          | naybu          | nyurrba-ny.        |  |
|-------|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------|--------------------|--|
|       | man-ERG:pt(A)                                          | knife.ABS(O)   | grind/sharpen-PAST |  |
|       | 'The man sharpened the knife.'                         |                |                    |  |
| (147) | Bama                                                   | nyunba-ny      | kada-ny-baja       |  |
|       | Aborigine.ABS(S)                                       | turn.back-PAST | come-PAST-again    |  |
|       | nyungu-wun-bu                                          | bayan-ba.      |                    |  |
|       | 3sg-POSS-LOC                                           | camp-LOC       |                    |  |
|       | 'The Aborigine turned back and came back to his camp.' |                |                    |  |

(1 48) Karrkay bambay-ma-ny. child.ABS(S) sick -INCHO-PAST 'The child fell ill.'

(iii) Imperative -¢ - -y - -ka

This form is typically used in an order or request addressed to a second person or persons. However, it has also been attested with first person dual or plural forms expressing an invitation or suggestion 'let's do ... !' (see §4.7 for imperative clauses).

The three allomorphs of imperative inflection are conditioned by conjugation class and the number of root or stem syllables of a verb.

Disyllabic roots in I-conjugation have zero inflection for imperative:

- ( 149) Yarraman kari kanga! horse.ABs(o) NEG chase.IMP 'Don't chase the horse!'
- (1 50) Jarruja dida! trousers.ABS(O) put.on.IMP 'Put your pants on!'

Three I-conjugation verbs have suppletive roots in imperative form:

| Citation | Imperative |            |
|----------|------------|------------|
| daji-l   | daya       | 'give'     |
| nyaji-l  | nyaka      | 'see/hear' |
| mani-l   | mana       | 'get'      |

These forms have been analysed in §3.8.3.2 (i) above.

Disyllabic roots in y-conjugation take imperative inflection -y, for example:

- (151) Dunga-y-baja! go-IMP-again 'Go back!'
- ( 1 52) Kari yirrka-y! NEG shout-IMp 'Don't shout!'

Since y-conjugation verbs have the same inflectional suffix for non-past tense and imperative, and the subject, i.e. the addressee, is often included in an imperative clause (see §4.7), the only certain distinguishing factor between a nonpast declarative and an imperative clause is the intonation contour (see §2.6.3).

Roots and stems with more than two syllables of either conjugation take the allomorph -ka, for example:

- (1 53) N gawa kararr-ba yijarri-ka! baby.ABS(O) blanket-LOC put-IMP 'Put the baby on the blanket!'
- (1 54) Mara julurri-ji-ka! hand.ABS(O) wash-REFL-IMP 'Wash your hands !'
- (1 55) Kuku-ku binal-ma-ka! language-DAT know-INCHO-IMP 'Learn language!'

Note that compounds and causative stems formed with -bunga-l, -man i-I, etc. (see §3.8.5.1 and §3.8.5.2) do not take suffix -ka but zero inflection for imperative. This means that only the number of syllables of the second (stem-forming) component is relevant, not the number of syllables of the whole stem.

( 1 56) Wumbul-bunga! hot -CA US.lMP 'Heat [it] up!'

Furthermore, causative stems formed with mani-l show the suppletive root mana ill imperatives, for example:

( 1 57) Kari daray-mana! NEG fall-CAUS.lMP 'Don't drop [it]!'

For these reasons, and because of the way in which they reduplicate, causative stems are most appropriately regarded as compounds rather than derivations (see §3.8.5. 1 ).

# (iv) 1rrealis -nyaku

An irrealis verb form indicates that an action that should or could have taken place does or did not occur for some reason. 1rrealis verb forms are used in independent clauses, which may or may not be co-ordinated with another clause stating why the action is/was prevented. The irrealis inflection itself does not contain temporal reference; this must be inferred from context.

| (158) | Ngayu      | badur-iji          | dunga-nyaku.                                                         |
|-------|------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
|       | 1sg.NOM(S) | fishing.line-COMIT | go-IRR                                                               |
|       |            |                    | 'I would go/would have gone fishing [but I cannot for some reason].' |

(1 59) N gayu nuka-nyaku minya, kari yinya minya kabu. 1 sg.NOM(A) eat-IRR meat.ABS(O) but that.ABs(s) meat.ABS(S) rotten 'I would have eaten that meat, but it was rotten.'

## (v) Purposive -nkV

The purposive inflection follows Kuku Yalanji vowel-harmony rules and has allomorphs -nka after final root or stem vowels a and i, and -nku after final vowel u. The Kuku Yalanji purposive inflection is presumably cognate with the widespread purposive inflection -gu in Australian languages.

A purposive verb form expresses 'desire or intention to Verb'. It may be used in independent or subordinate clauses and occurs obligatorily with adjectival particles (see §3.9.1 ).

- (1 60) N gayu mayi waju-nku. 1 sg.NOM(A) food.ABS(O) cook-PURP 'I want to cook some food.'
- (161) Nyulu binal dama-nka. 3sg.NOM(S) know spear-PURP 'He knows how to spear. '

( 1 62) Jana makarr wundi-ny kuyu wubul 3pLNOM(A) net.ABS(O) take-PAST fish.ABS(O) many.ABS(O) bangka-nka. catch/gather large quantities-PURP 'They took a net to catch a lot of fish.'

For a full discussion of purposive constructions see §4.4. 1.

(vi) Precautionary -nyji

The precautionary verb form indicates an undesirable event that should and can be avoided or prevented. A precautionary clause is typically subordinated to a main clause which describes the action that is or should be taken against the undesirable outcome.17

<sup>17</sup> Dixon ( 1 980:380) uses the term "apprehensional inflection" and ( 1977:350) '''lest' subordinate clause" for Yidiny, which has the cognate inflections -ndi - -ldi - di. I prefer the term 'precautionary' for Kuku Yalanji because this construction normally states explicitly what precaution has to be taken against something.

- (1 63) N gayu jawun-unji dunga-y I sg.NOM(S) friend-COMIT:pt go-NONPAST 'I go with a friend lest I get lonely. ' milkabujar-ma-nyji. lonely-INCHO-PRECAUT
- ( 1 64) Jujubala waju jarramali kada-nyji! ironwood.ABS(O) burn.lMP thunderstorm.ABS(S) come-PRECAUT 'Bum some ironwood to prevent the thunderstorm from coming!'

Precautionary constructions are discussed in §4.4.2.

(vii) Successive -nyjiku

A successive verb form in a subordinate clause refers to the latter of two successive events, which have no causal connection. The preceding event is expressed in the main clause, for example:

- ( 1 65) Jana maYl kunba-y-mani-ny nganjan 3pl.NOM(A) food.ABS(O) finish-y-CAUS-PAST father.ABS(S) 'They had finished the food before [their] father woke up. ' wandi-nyjiku. wake.up-succ
- ( 1 66) Nyulu yirrka-ny wula-nyjiku. 3sg.NOM(S) cry. out-PAST die-SUCC 'He cried out before he died.'

For a discussion of successive constructions see §4.4.3.

The successive inflection -nyjiku and precautionary -nyji are similar in form. They also share the semantic component of 'following event', successive as an actual time reference and precautionary as an expected undesirable event. The cognate 'anticipatory' inflection -yiku in Guugu Yimidhirr can apparently imply either of these aspects (Haviland 1 979a:93).

#### (viii) Unmarked/subordinate inflection -ny V

Like purposive suffix -nkV this suffix follows vowel-harmony rules and has the allomorphs -nya after final root vowels a and i, and -nyu after root vowel u. This suffix is used in various functions, all of which have the common aspect of 'general subordination'.

In the Nyungkul dialect verbal suffix -nyV is used as an inflection that is apparently unmarked for tense or aspect to offset non-events or background information in narratives, i.e. 'general subordination' at discourse level. This discourse function is discussed in §5.5.1 .2. The Yalanji dialect does not make this distinction in discourse, but uses normal tense inflections. In both Yalanji and Nyungkul verbal suffix -nyV occurs in the following subordinate clauses: causal, simultaneous action, prior event, hypothetical reason.

In the causal subordinate clause -nyV is clearly an inflection since the verb + -nyV form may not be inflected further in any other way, for example:

( 1 67) N gayu bambay-ma-ny mayngku kayal nuka-nya. I sg.NOM(S) sick-INCHO-PAST mango.ABS(O) unripe.ABS(O) eat-sUB 'I became sick from eating unripe mangoes.'

A noun phrase in corresponding causal function requires ablative inflection. (See §4.1 .4.4 (iv) (d).)

In the other subordinate clauses, however, the verb + -nyV form is inflected for case. For this reason -ny V has to be regarded as a nominaliser in these instances as had been indicated in §3.2.3.6. Indeed, verbal inflection -nyV and nominaliser -nyV may be unrelated homophonous suffixes, but the basic function of 'subordination' common to all uses of -nyV seems to indicate that there is some connection. 18 Because of this common function all occurrences of -nyV in subordinate clauses are glossed as SUB (ordination), but in its nonevent marking capacity in Nyungkul narratives suffix -nyV is glossed as UM (unmarked inflection) to distinguish its use from subordinate clauses. Syntax and function of subordinate clauses with verb + -nyV forms are discussed in §4.4.4. 1-4.4.4.4.

### 3.8.5 Verbal stem formation

Kuku Yalanji has only relatively few verb roots, but several highly productive stemforming processes. Causative verb stems may be formed from any nominal, intransitive verb or adjectival particle by regular compounding with a causative root (see §3 .8.5. 1 ). Numerous other compounds are formed by combining nominals or particles with free-form verb roots, often resulting in idiomatic expressions (see §3.8.5.2). Inchoative verb stems may be derived from almost all non-verbal parts of speech with the stem-forming suffix -ma-l (see §3.8.5.3).

Apart from these processes which actually create new verbs, there are two syntactic (reciprocal and reflexive/general intransitive) and two non-syntactic derivations (reduplication and plural subject agreement), which are discussed in §3.8.5.4-3 .8.5.5.

## 3.8.5. 1 Causative compounds

Causative verbs in Kuku Yalanji can be classed into two categories according to the result that they imply. One type of causative compound refers to the causation of a state, the other to the causation of an action referred to by an intransitive verb. The former consist of a nominal root or stem, or an adjectival particle plus 'state causative' component -bunga-l or -kanga-l; the latter of an intransitive verb root plus 'action causative' component -mani-l. (The causation of a transitive action cannot be expressed by a verbal compound, but requires an explicit statement as to how the action was caused, e.g. 'he told him to do something' or 'he forced him to do something', etc.)

Causative components -kanga-l and -mani-l also occur as free-form roots meaning 'chase, disturb' and 'get' respectively. Suffix -bunga-l, on the other hand, cannot be used independently but the morphological behaviour of -bungal forms in reduplication and imperative is exactly like that of the other causative compounds or of idiomatic compounds. (For imperative forms see §3.8.4.2. (iii), for reduplication §3.8.5.5. (ii).) It would therefore be reasonable to regard -bunga-l as a compound verb-forming root with the semantic content 'make into Noun/make Adjective' rather than a derivational suffix.

<sup>18</sup> Consider also the similarity between -nyV and irrealis -nyaku, even though the latter apparently does not follow vowel harmony rules. But the two forms could well be related (cf. irrealis and subordinate function of one prefix form in Mangarayi (Merian 1 98 1 ).

R. Hershberger's (1 964b:37) interpretation of -nyV as a 'verb serialiser' could correspond to the discourse function of this suffix in Nyngkul, although I do not know from which context her example was taken.

#### 98 Chapter 3

# (i) State-causative compounds with -bunga-l or -kanga-l

State-causative verbaliser -bunga-l has a reduced allomorph -ba-l, sometimes also -buwa-I, in rapid speech, but only the full form is used in reduplication. The form -bunga-l can attach to a nominal root or stem or adjectival particle.

Simple root + -bunga-l:

| dandi   | 'hard'   | dandi-bunga-l   | 'make hard'                       |
|---------|----------|-----------------|-----------------------------------|
| yarkin  | 'corpse' | yarkin-bunga-l  | 'kill'                            |
| manyarr | 'wife'   | manyarr-bunga-l | 'cause to be a wife (i.e. marry)' |
| binal   | 'know'   | binal-bunga-l   | 'teach'                           |

Reduplicated root + -bunga-l:

| kaka-kaka               | 'painful' | kaka-kaka-bunga-l   | 'make painful'    |
|-------------------------|-----------|---------------------|-------------------|
| bajay-bajay 'exhausted' |           | bajay-bajay-bunga-l | 'exhaust someone' |

Reduplication of the actual compound, which involves only the second component, is a different matter. While the above reduplicated nominal roots refer to the state that is caused, reduplication of the second element of the compound implies prolonged or repeated causation of a state, for example:

| (168) | Jana                                 | kuku        | muwul-bunga-l-bunga-l.      |
|-------|--------------------------------------|-------------|-----------------------------|
|       | 3pl.NOM(A)                           | word.ABS(O) | secret-CAUS-l-REDUP-NONPAST |
|       | 'They keep the word/message secret.' |             |                             |

A causative compound with a reduplicated stem may be further reduplicated, e.g. kakakaka-bunga-l-bunga-l 'keep making painful'.

Compound + bunga-l:

| jiba-wulawula         | 'sweet'   |
|-----------------------|-----------|
| jiba-wulawula-bunga-l | 'sweeten' |

Comitative stem + bunga-l:

| ngurrka-ji | 'have a scar'   | ngurrka-ji-bunga-l | 'scar someone' |
|------------|-----------------|--------------------|----------------|
| bubu-ji    | 'soiled, dirty' | bubu-ji-bunga-l    | 'make dirty'   |

The choice between -bunga-l and -kanga-l for a state-causative compound is made on semantic grounds. The form -bunga-l is the unmarked state-causative verbaliser, while -kanga-l, which also functions as an independent transitive verb meaning 'chase, disturb', implies in a compound verb 'causation of physical or emotional commotion', and can occur only with simple nominal roots.

| ngirray | 'weep'                | ngirray-kanga-l | 'evoke weeping'                         |
|---------|-----------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------|
| yinil   | 'afraid, fright'      | yinil-kanga-l   | 'evoke fright, frighten'                |
| bunjay  | 'laughter'            | bunjay-kanga-l  | 'evoke laughter'                        |
| burkur  | 'dirty, muddy (water) | burkur-kanga-l  | 'make water dirty by<br>stirring it up' |

Because of the semantic distinction between -bunga-l and -kanga-l some compounds can involve only one or the other, for example:

| 'evoke weeping'   | ngirray-kanga-l | NOT | ngirray-bunga-l |
|-------------------|-----------------|-----|-----------------|
| 'induce bleeding' | mula-kanga-l    | NOT | mula-bunga-l    |
| 'evoke anger'     | kuli-kanga-l    | NOT | kuli-bunga-l    |
| 'make dopey'      | juwa-bunga-l    | NOT | juwa-kanga-l    |
| 'make slow'       | waymbul-bunga-l | NOT | waymbul-kanga-l |

'teach' binal-bunga-l NOT binal-kanga-l

Other compounds, on the other hand, may take either -bunga-l or -kanga-l as second component according to context, for example: 

- ( 1 69) a. Karrkay-ngka kambi mumbu-bunga-ny. child-ERG:pt(A) clothes.ABS(O) dirty-CAUS-PAST 'The child made the clothes dirty.'
	- b. Karrkay-ngka bana mumbu-kanga-ny. child-ERG:pt(A) water.ABS(O) dirty-CAUS-PAST 'The child made the water dirty.' (i.e. by disturbing it)
- ( 1 70) a. Maral-angka mayi jirra-bunga-ny. girl-ERG:pt(A) food.ABS(O) overdone-CAUS-PAST 'The girl overcooked the food.'
	- b. Baya jirra-kanga-¢-baja! fire.ABS(O) overdone-CAUS-IMP-again 'Stoke the fire again !'
	- c. Yundu nganya kari jirra-kanga! 2sg.NOM(A) I sg.ACC(O) NEG overdone-CAUS.lMP 'Leave me alone!' (i.e. don't stir up my temper)

(ii) Action-causative compounds with -mani-l

Root -*mani-l*, appended to an intransitive verb, creates a transitive causative verbal compound. In the formation of such a compound a link morpheme -y- is inserted between the two roots after final vowels a or u; .this link morpheme is the same for intransitive roots of either conjugation. Thus the formula for an action causative compound verb is: 

> intransitive verb -at -u# +y +*mani-l*

Examples of verb root + mani-l are:

BUT

| dara-y | 'fall'  | dara-y-mani-l | 'cause to fall, drop' |
|--------|---------|---------------|-----------------------|
| jana-y | 'stand' | jana-y-mani-l | 'cause to stand'      |
| wala-l | 'enter' | wala-y-mani-l | 'cause to enter'      |

(171) Waybala-ngka *maral school-bu* white.man-ERG:pt(A) girl.ABS(O) school-LOC 'The white man made the girl go to school.' wala-y-mani-ny. enter-y-CAUS-PAST Examples of compound verb + mani-l are:

| julbarrwarri-y | 'slip'       | julbarr-warri-mani-l | 'cause to slip'       |
|----------------|--------------|----------------------|-----------------------|
| walu-dunga-y   | 'be annoyed' | walu-dunga-y-mani-l  | 'cause to be annoyed' |

I presume that the action-causative verbaliser -mani-l is related to the verb root mani-l 'get' because the imperative form of action causative compounds uses the suppletive form of mani-l 'get', as injana-y-mana 'make (it) stand up!'

In Guugu Yimidhirr the monosyllabic roots maa-naa 'get' and causative -ma-naa appear to be similarly related. Both take irregular past tense inflection -ni, e.g. maa-ni, and the same suffix for stem formation before further inflections (Haviland 1 979a:84-85).

One idiomatic use of action-causative -mani-l with a transitive verb must be noted: ngaki-l 'hide' + -mani-l means 'elope', for example:

( 1 72) Nyulu ngaki-mani-ny yinya jalbu. 3sg.NOM(A) hide-CAUS-PAST that.ABs(O) woman.ABS(O) 'He eloped with that woman.'

R. Hershberger ( 1 964b:50) states that if an action-causative verb stem is "changed back to intransitive" the causative verbaliser "is dropped and the subject changes to locative" (my emphasis). This observation is true only in so far as action-causative stems, like other transitive verbs, may be passivised, in which case the agent takes locative inflection. However, the causative root -mani-l is not deleted, but the verb stem intransitivised with suffix -ji-, for example:

( 1 73) Karrkay ngamu-ndu school-bu wala-y-mani-ji-ny. child.ABS(S) mother-LOC school-LOC enter-y-CAUS-ITR-PAST 'Mother mistakenly sent the child to school (it was still too young). '

(For passive formation and functions see §4.2.4.3.)

#### 3.8.5.2 Idiomatic verbal compounds

Apart from the very productive compound formation with causative roots, many other compounds are formed by combining a nominal root with a verb. Such compounds are always inseparable and usually have an idiomatic meaning that is often only loosely connected with the semantic content of the two components.

Body-part terms and the nominal root wawu 'breath, spirit' are most often used in verbal compounds. (For use of body parts in nominal compounds see §3.2.3. 1 0.) Other nouns occur less frequently and adjectives least of all. To give a few examples:

### body part + verb:

| mara-warri-y  | (hand-run-y)   | 'crawl'                      |
|---------------|----------------|------------------------------|
| jiba-warri-y  | (liver-run-y)  | 'get startled, get a fright' |
| milka-wula-y  | (ear-die-y)    | 'forget'                     |
| bujil-janji-l | (nose-bathe-l) | 'drown (itr)'                |
| walu-dunga-y  | (face-go-y)    | 'faint'                      |
| dukul-warri-y | (head-run-y)   | 'throw a tantrum'            |
