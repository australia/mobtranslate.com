introduced as transitive object in the appended texts. We can assume that a new topic is usually introduced in S or A function, which coincides with the normal choice of topic in a clause with unmarked word order. Once a topic has been introduced, zero ana ph ora can apply, even if the referent appears in different syntactic functions. However, as is evident from the texts, a topic that is introduced in s function is far more likely to be followed by a sequence of zero anaphora in the same or different functions, than is a topic that is introduced as A.

I have looked at 50 topic introductions followed by one or more instances of zero anaphora. Of the 50 introductions 35 are in S function and 15 in A function. As can be seen in Table 5.1 there is evidently no problem for a topic that has been introduced as S to be followed by several zero references in all syntactic functions (20 occurrences of S, 20 occurrences of A, and 2 occurrences of 0). Again, a topic in 0 function is quite rare.

| Function of topic<br>in introduction |    | Function of topic in subsequent<br>clauses with zero anaphora |    |   |
|--------------------------------------|----|---------------------------------------------------------------|----|---|
|                                      |    | S                                                             | A  | O |
| S                                    | 35 | 20                                                            | 20 | 2 |
| A                                    | 15 | 3                                                             | 12 | - |

# Table 5.1: Syntactic functions of topic in introduction and subsequent clauses with zero anaphora

If, on the other hand, a topic is introduced as A, subsequent zero anaphora is apparently restricted. It can apply freely where the referent remains in the same syntactic function (12 occurrences), but is rare where the referent assumes different syntactic function (3 occurrences of S, no occurrence of 0).

Like switch reference (see ยง5.2.1 .2), switch function does not require any particular grammatical devices in Kuku Yalanji. Again, Kuku Yalanji differs in this respect from some other Australian languages. In Dyirbal, for instance, a switch from S or 0 to A must be indicated by antipassive with verbal derivation -lJay-, and a switch from A to S or 0 involves a special verbal inflection -lJura (Dixon 1 972:7 1-74 and 77-79 respectively). As Silverstein (1976: 1 56) remarks: "The markers -lJay- and lJura, 'then', are discourse markers that show the switch of underlying function of co-referential noun phrases".

To summarise, on the evidence of topic introduction with subsequent zero anaphora for same or different function, we may say that the first choice of topic in Kuku Yalanji is a noun phrase in S function and second choice is a noun phrase in A function. This agrees with Haviland's (1 979a:1 59) statement for Guugu Yimidhirr: "s NPs are unambiguously available as topics and can be linked with S, A or 0 NPs in second and subsequent clauses".

#### 5.3.2.3 Choice of referent as topic

The choice of a particular referent as topic correlates on the one hand with the preferred syntactic function of the topic as S or A, and on the other hand with the notion of animacy versus mammacy.

Unlike nouns, pronouns, which refer exclusively to animate beings in Kuku Yalanji, and particularly to humans, are not formally distinct for S or A function. That is to say that pronoun forms are distinguished as topic versus non-topic and are independent from the verb, whereas noun forms are determined by the verb according to whether it is transitive or intransitive. This would suggest that those referents that are always denoted by a pronoun, i.e. first and second person pronoun referents, are most likely to be topic if they occur in a narrative.

Further, we have seen that in the less frequent cases where a lower animate or even inanimate referent as agent acts upon a higher animate referent as transitive object, the 0 NP is preferred in leftmost, i.e. topic position, as in (638) above, or the clause may be passivised to transform the transitive object into S and therefore natural topic, as in (640). Such formations are also the preferred form in elicited sentences with a lower animate agent acting upon a higher animate patient.

We can thus set up the following hierarchy of choice of referent as topic:

- (i) first and second person pronoun referents
- (ii) animate referents
- (iii) inanimate referents.

### 5.3.2. 4 Conclusions

Following the above findings, some speculations can be made on the classification of Kuku Yalanji within the framework of topic prominent (Tp) and subject prominent (Sp) languages developed by Li and Thompson (1 976). This framework includes a diachronic schema for topic prominent and subject prominent languages with the following stages (Li & Thompson 1 976:485):

A Topic-prominent language

Topic notion integrated into basic sentence structure; topic and subject are distinct.

B Neither subject-prominent nor topic-prominent

Topic becomes more closely integrated into case frame of verb.

C Subject-prominent

Topic has become integrated into case frame of verb as subject; subject and topic are often indistinct, subjects have some non-topic properties; sentences with clear topics are highly marked.

D Both topic-prominent and subject-prominent

Topic sentences become less marked and more basic. (The next stage of development after this is again A.)

Clearly, there is a correlation between topic and grammatical subject in Kuku Yalanji which means that it is not a topic prominent language. However, the grammatical subject in Kuku Yalanji has two distinct and clearly marked functions for nominal NPs: intransitive subject (S) and transitive subject (A). Of these S is favoured as topic over A, although A is a possible choice under more restrictive circumstances. Furthermore, sentences with zero anaphora for the topic do not have to be clearly marked in Kuku Yalanji; they can be

transitive, even though the topic is introduced in S function. Compare this with Dyirbal, a subject-prominent language according to Li and Thompson ( 1 976:460), where a clause with topic in A function following a clause with the same topic in S function must be intransitivised through antipassive so that the second function of the topic is identical with the first (Dixon 1 972:7 1-74).

Therefore, because topic correlates with grammatical subject in Kuku Yalanji, with a preference for intransitive subject over transitive subject as topic, and because topic sentences do not have to be specifically marked, I suggest that Kuku Yalanji is both topic-prominent and subject-prominent, according to the Li and Thompson classification.

### 5.4 Localised highlighting

A Kuku Yalanji speaker may emphasise any single clause constituent that he or she wishes to bring to the listener's special attention, either by a change in word order or with the help of emphatic clitics.

#### 5. 4. 1 Specifically marked word order

Any clause constituent may be placed in prominent leftmost position for special emphasis. An example of this is in text 1 2, lines 40-42:

| (641) 40 | Nyulu                       | kulji       | yalbay-ku        | mani-ny. |  |
|----------|-----------------------------|-------------|------------------|----------|--|
|          | 3sg.NOM(A)                  | rock.ABS(O) | big.ABS(O)-EMPH1 | get-PAST |  |
|          | 'He got a really big rock.' |             |                  |          |  |

- 41 Kulji yalbay-ku jurrnga-ny, yijarri-ny. rock.ABS(O) big.ABS(O}-EMPHl push-PAST put-PAST '[He] pushed the really big rock and set it up. '
- 42 Baral-ba-ku yijarri-ny kulji yalbay. road-LOC-EMPHI put-PAST rock.ABS(O) big.ABS(O) 'Right on the road [he] set the big rock.'

(This example also displays the emphatic clitic -ku, to be discussed in the next sub-section.)

Line 40 has unmarked word order. Line 41, with zero anaphora for the topic, leaves *kulji* yalbayku in leftmost position, which helps to alert the audience to the significance of the rock. Line 42 begins with baralbaku 'right on the road' to emphasise the implications of this trap that is so ingeniously constructed by the Aborigine.

Verbs, adverbs and adjectives may also be fronted for emphasis. An example of a verb in clause initial position is in text 1 2, line 25:

(642) Bundanda-ny nyulu nyaji-l-nyaji-ny. sit.REDUP-PAST 3sg.NOM(A) see-l-REDUP-PAST 'He sat and watched.' ("Sitting down, he watched.")

This stresses the composure of the Aborigine in the face of the approaching group of police.

Apart from simple fronting for emphasis, reprise constructions (see Grimes 1 975:342) are frequently used in Kuku Yalanji discourse. Reprise involves the statement of a noun phrase

in initial position, before the clause as it were, with an anaphoric pronoun following in the slot where this NP would normally occur, for example:

Reprise of S NP:

|       | 'White men and Chinese, they came to the Palmer River to get gold.' |                |            |              |           |  |

| kill-l-REDUP-PAST                             |                          |                       |                                     |                        |
| 'Many Aborigines, the white men killed them.' |                          |                       |                                     |                        |

Another example of reprise applying to an 0 NP was given in sentence (639).

#### 5 .4.2 Emphatic clitics

The semantic distinctions of emphatic clitics -ku (EM PH 1), -lu (Yalanji), -la (Nyungkul) (both EMPH2) and -bi (EMPH3) are not entirely clear. They appear to have different emphatic strength and play different roles in the interaction between speaker and listener.

The form -ku is the most frequently occurring emphatic clitic and therefore appears to be a rather commonplace emphatic marker (similar to 'really' in English). The assumption that it is relatively weak is supported by the fact that it may be followed by other emphatic clitics *lu* and -*bi* (see for instance -*ku-lu* in examples (629) and (630).

Clitics -*la* in the Nyungkul dialect and -*lu* in the Yalanji dialect are similar in form and have partly similar functions. Yalanji -*lu* is used predominantly to mark whole parts of text as particularly important events, which will be discussed in ยง5.5.1.1. Nyungkul -*la* does not have this function, but both dialects may use -*la* or -*lu* to emphasise individual nouns. These clitics seem to request the audience to pay special attention and could be translated as 'hark!' or 'pay attention!'

A typical use of -*lu* in this function occurred in conversation and is worth while recounting here: Mrs Mabel Webb had begun to tell me about a trip that she had undertaken together with some other women, when she sneezed. I asked whether she had a cold: โYundu ngikiji?โ Mrs Webb misunderstood me as saying: โmijiji?โ, i.e. enquiring whether the people involved in her tale were white women, and she replied somewhat impatiently: โKari,

*bamalu!*โ โNo, they were Aborigines (do pay attention to what I say)!โ Nyungkul -*la* is exemplified in text 51, line 97, repeated below:

(646) Nyulu warndiny kayala. 'It got up, the dog [did].' (fhe dead dog well and truly got up again - note this, listener!)

While -*ku* and -*lu*/-*la* could be seen to assert the significance of something relative to the context of the plot, clitic -*bi* may have its function more as an affective marker in the interactive context in which a story is told. H. Hershberger and R. Hershberger (1 982:294) suggest -bi to indicate "surprise about something in the narrative". The listener is invited to share a sense of amazement about some event. Consider some of its uses in the appended texts:

(647) text 36, line 37 yinyabi bijarrmuny

'that one from the dream!'

(648) text 36, line 53

yala bijarrbi 'just like the dream!'

In both these examples -bi emphasises the astonishing fact that the events in real life tally with the child's dream.

(649) text 51, line 72

Nyulu wulman yanyabi bundandany ... 'There was this old man ... ' (who is he? what's he up to?)

In this example the speaker's signal of surprise could be regarded as aptly adding emphasis to the sudden coming into focus of this new (and very important) participant.

(650) text 3, line 6 bubu julbarrbi 'the ground was [extremely] slippery!'

Here, we may infer from clitic -bi that the road was a good deal more slippery than the narrator's party had expected.

# 5.5 Events and non-events

"The first distinction made in the analysis of discourse is between events and non-events" (Grimes 1 975:35). Events represent what happens in a narrative, whereas non-events provide information about where, when, how or why something happens. The following sections concentrate on grammatical devices used in Yalanji and Nyungkul to set off events from non-events; the use of lexical verbs to indicate spatial setting; and the function of some particles in contrasting what did not happen from what did happen.

#### 5.5.1 Basic distinction between events and non-events

Nyungkul speakers and Yalanji speakers have different ways of distinguishing between events and non-events. Nyungkul speakers indicate non-events by using a specific verb inflection. Yalanji speakers, on the other hand, mark particularly important events with an emphatic clitic.

### 5.5. 1. 1 Important events in Yalanji dialect

In the Yalanji dialect a narrator may make copious use of the emphatic clitic -*lu* to mark events deemed to be particularly important. This clitic has been defined above (ยง5.4.2) as an attention-getting device. It may attach to all kinds of clause components and often follows the general emphatic clitic -ku.

Let us look at the excerpts from text 3 which contain the first two -*lu*-marked events in a very long and meandering narrative. Previous to line 1 of the excerpt Mrs Walker had related how her party had prepared for the trip. Lines 1-14 tell us how the group is driving along in the rain. In lines 1 5-1 7 there is the first significant event: they encounter difficulties on the slippery road, the driver tries to control the car, but the car keeps slipping about in a most alarming fashion. Clitic -lu occurs three times, always with verbs and in conjunction with -ku. Once this problem is overcome, the journey proceeds 'uneventfully' and no -lu is used until the event involving the strange visitor on the campsite. But it is not really the appearance of the stranger that is marked as significant, rather the unsatisfactory behaviour of the young male members of Mrs Walker's party. In lines 43-49 -lu is used six times, always in connection with nouns. In the quotations in lines 45 and 49 -lu is used probably more in the function of localised highlight, nevertheless it occurs within the boundaries of this particular event. (The most frequent occurrence of -lu that I have encountered is 12 times in 10 text lines, preceded by 28 text lines in which -lu appeared only 5 times and widely apart as local emphatic marker.)

To sum up, we can say that emphatic clitic -lu in Yalanji, when used repeatedly throughout a section of text, marks this section as a significant event in contrast to others. Sequences marked with clitic -lu may be regarded as the 'high points' or 'peaks' in a Yalanji narrative (see Longacre & Levinsohn 1977:109).

#### 5.5. 1.2 Non-events versus events in Nyungkul dialect

While Yalanji uses a special device for marking peaks, Nyungkul applies a certain morphological feature, the unmarked verb inflection -nyV, for non-events. At sentence level, suffix -*nyV* functions as subordination marker (see ยง4.4.4). However, it also occurs frequently in texts, in strings of verbs or several consecutive sentences, where there is no evidence at all for subordination; i.e. its function cannot be explained in syntactic terms. In such an environment -*nyV* appears to indicate 'non-event', a discourse function.<sup>6</sup>

Consider text 51 which contains in lines 61โ67 an explanatory remark on how people prepared ground ovens in the old days. This part of text was clearly set off as a parenthetic remark by the speaker's intonation and voice quality. In other words, he interrupted the story

<sup>6</sup>See Grimes' ( 1975:93) observation that the aspectual system of some languages can be fully understood only within the framework of discourse.

in order to explain to me the technicalities of the ground oven that had just been set up by the participants of the story. And throughout this parenthetic remark he used only unmarked inflection -*nyV* which occurs nowhere else in this text.

On the evidence that unmarked inflection -*nyV* is used in a clearly non-event situation in this context, we can infer from this how a Nyungkul speaker structures his or her narrative into events and non-events by means of this unmarked verbal inflection. In text 12 for instance, lines 5-21 contain predominantly unmarked verb inflection. Here the narrator conveys information about the hero's habits and one of his past exploits, before launching into the story proper (with normal past-tense inflection), which deals with the particular incident of how the hero set a trap for the police. Within the non-event span the narrator briefly changes to past tense inflection in lines 15 and 1 7. These lines deal with the previous encounter between hero and police and thus represent something like an event within a nonevent.

In text 36 variation between past tense and unmarked inflection is somewhat more complicated. The main problem here is that we, as non-Nyungkul outsiders, would probably interpret the utterances containing unmarked inflection as rather belonging to an event sequence. But if we are guided by the presence or absence of unmarked inflection -*nyV*, we see the plot developing in the following way: lines 1โ4 state that everyone was asleep and that the child had a dream about a crocodile. This information tells us in effect what the story is about and the speaker treats this as event (past tense inflection). Lines 5 and 6, relating that the child did not sleep and cried out, are treated as non-event (unmarked inflection). We already know that the child is having a bad dream and so we may infer that the speaker is now setting the scene for the following event, the interaction between the distressed child and the concerned adults. This, as well as the subsequent narrative up to line 42, is recounted in event form with past tense inflections. In line 43, again perhaps surprisingly because it is in the middle of an action-packed sequence, the speaker switches back to unmarked inflection for non-event. But what is actually happening? The crocodile has got the child and the onlookers are distressed - what more is there to be said? The terrible accident has happened and the following is no more than a fading repetition of the previous happening. (Switching to non-event may perhaps also serve to signal to the audience that this is indeed the end of the child and that there is no hope for a happy turn in the affair.) The narrator then concludes the story with some final event-related remarks (past tense in line 52) to assert the unhappy ending.

H. Hershberger and R. Hershberger's (1 982) interpretation of -nyV as "habitual" would be appropriate for many of its occurrences in the appended texts (e.g. text 1 2, lines 5-14 and text 51, lines 6 1-67), but not for all of them (e.g. text 36, lines 5, 6, 30, 31, 43-47). The term 'unmarked verbal inflection' is preferable as the more general term.

Comparing the various functions of unmarked verbal inflection -nyV one could say that -nyV basically serves to relegate information to a subordinate role. It does so at sentence level by indicating subordinate clauses and it does so at discourse level by identifying nonevents.

### 5.5.2 Spatial and temporal setting

In Kuku Yalanji, as in many Aboriginal narrative traditions, stories often have centrally to do with the protagonists' movement through time and space. Participants usually move about, sometimes covering considerable distances, with different events happening at

different places. Direction of movement and locations are always clearly defined by the use of locative, ablative, abessive and proper place names or general local descriptions, as for instance throughout text 51.

Spatial setting in Nyungkul can be accomplished by general non-event marking, but another way to set the spatial scene that is common to both Nyungkul and Yalanji is to describe a place in non-past tense as opposed to the past tense narrative. An example of this is found at the very beginning of text 1 2, where the speaker also addresses me personally since he knew that I was familiar with the particular area.

Motion verbs *kada-y* 'come' and *dunga-y* 'go' play a significant part in the spatial setting of a narrative. *Kada-y* is always used with reference to a goal towards which the participant moves, as for instance in text 51, lines 3-4:

- (65 1) 3 Bakarrmuku-muny kada-ny, kada-ny kada-ny kada-ny, Wakooka.Stn-ABL come-PAST come-PAST ... '[They] came from Wakooka Station, came on and on and on,
	- 4 bula yuwulbuwun kada-ny. 3du.NOM(S) Jeannie.River come-PAST they came to the Jeannie River. '

Thus kada-y 'come' serves to indicate both 'transit' (the goal is not yet reached but it is implied) and 'arrival' when the goal is reached.

Dunga-y 'go', on the other hand, may indicate 'departure' as for instance in text 51, line 37:

| (652) | Dunga-ny-da                                                             | wulbuman         | wangkar | dunga-ny | kaya-nda   |
|-------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|---------|----------|------------|
|       | go-PAST-TEMP 1                                                          | old.woman.ABS(S) | upwards | go-PAST  | dog-LOC:pt |
|       | mani-nka.<br>get-PURP                                                   |                  |         |          |            |
|       | 'Off went the old woman (leaving the two young fellows), went up to the |                  |         |          |            |
|       | dog to get [it].'                                                       |                  |         |          |            |

As the second occurrence of *dunga-ny* in the above example implies, *dunga-y* 'go' may also serve as a term that is unmarked for 'departure', but represents motion from the perspective of the participant, rather than from the perspective of the goal like kada-y 'come'. Consider also text 51, line 5:

(653) Bula kada-ny, bula wawubaja-nga dunga-ny. 3du.NOM(S) come-PAST 3du.NOM(S) river-LOC go-PAST 'They came and they went to the river. '

Here, dunga-ny clearly does not indicate 'departure', since this river is the very goal where they just arrived, but simply 'movement' by the participants.

Thus dunga-y 'go' and kada-y 'come' have the varied discourse function of indicating 'departure', 'transit' and 'arrival'7 as well as changing the perspective of the narrative; kada-y is used from the perspective of the goal and dunga-y from the perspective of the participants.

Narratives usually take place in the past and temporal setting is often established by time words like ngadiku 'a long time ago' or adverbial clauses of time like ngayu karrkayku

<sup>7</sup> Compare the segmentation of movements into 'departure', 'transit' and 'arrival' in travel and hunting narratives in Ngaanyatjarra (Glass 1 980: 1 23- 1 4 1 ).

'when I was a child', ngayku nganjan warruku 'when my father was a young man', etc. (see ยง3.8.6.2). However, often a narrative as a whole is not specifically set in a particular time, but verbal inflections are sufficient to indicate that it happened in the past. Temporal setting of episodes within a narrative is accomplished solely by time words, e.g. wunkuny 'next day', or other temporal references such as mudu-waju-ny 'at daybreak', miyil-wujurr-wujurr 'at dusk', etc. (For time words see ยง3.4.)

# 5.5.3 Collatera,l: telling what did not happen

Particles kari, yamba and balu have the narrative discourse function of indicating what did not happen out of a range of possibilities, sometimes against expectations. According to Grimes (1 975:65) such "collateral devices" serve to set up alternatives to the actual events in a narrative and the fact that alternatives are mentioned "makes what actually does happen stand out in sharper relief than if it were told without collateral".

The main collateral function of particle *kari* lies in negating an alternative that is not necessarily stated but is implicit. In ยง4.3.2 I have shown that particle *kari*, at the beginning of the second of two conjoined clauses, negates in retrospect the content of the first clause. *Kari* may also be used initially in an independent clause and we can infer from this that something which could have been expected, but remained unsaid, did not take place; only one of several alternatives happened. Thus the semantic content of particle *kari* in this context could be paraphrased as 'several alternatives are possible but only the following applies'. Consider an example of two consecutive sentences:

| (654) i. | Nganjin-ku-lu                                                          | murruji wukurri-l-wukurri-ny |
|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
|          | 1pl.exc.NOM(A)-EMPH1-EMPH2 unable follow-l-REDUP-PAST                  |                              |
|          | kuyu-lu<br>bana-nga janji-ny.<br>fish.ABS(S)-EMPH2 water-LOC swim-PAST |                              |
|          | 'We could not follow, the fish was swimming in the water.'             |                              |
| ii.      | Kari ngamu-ngku-lu                                                     | yalama-ny: "Yubal            |
|          | but mother-ERG:pt-EMPH2 say-PAST                                       | 2du.NOM(A)                   |
|          | juwal-da dama!"                                                        |                              |
|          | digging.stick-INST spear-IMP                                           |                              |
|          | 'But mother said: "You two spear it with a digging stick!"'            |                              |

Seeing that they could not follow the fish (which was injured and expected to exhaust itself), these people had two options: leave it alone or try to get it by some other means. *Kari* implies that one of these options was discarded and the subsequent clause indicates which one was chosen. Another example is in text 51, lines 29-30:

| (655) 29 | "Ngali                        | kuwa-muny | kada-ri-ny."  |
|----------|-------------------------------|-----------|---------------|
|          | 1du inc.NOM(S)                | West-ABL  | come-PLS-PAST |
|          | "We two came from the West."" |           |               |

30 UN gay, kari wangkar-muny ngayu kankada-ny. " INTER but up-ABL I sg.NOM(S) come.REDUP-PAST '''I see, but I came from up there.'"

The second speaker, the old woman with the dog, could have come from several directions, including the one that the first speaker came from. *Kari* is used to deny this latter possibility

before the woman says where she did come from. In this particular context it is significant that the woman disassociates her own point of departure from that of the two fellows, since she wants to conceal the true nature of her dog which was left behind on the way.

The co-ordination particle yamba (see ยง4.3.2) qualifies a previous statement, usually describing a state, by adding a contrastive aspect. Hence the use of yamba is akin to the 'adversative' function of *kari*, for example:

- (656) Walkarr kul-ji kari, black.goanna.ABS(S) rage-COMIT NEG yamba dirra but teeth.ABS(S) germs-mun-ji minya kabu nuka-nya. germs-mun-COMIT meat.ABS(O) rotten.ABS(O) eat-sUB 'The black goanna is not vicious, but [its] teeth are full of germs from eating rotten meat. '
- (657) J ana mala-minya 3pl.NOM(S) expert-meat like Aborigine but 3pl-POSS.ABS(S) bubu walu-yindu. land.ABS(S) face-other yala bama, yamba jana-nga 'They (the Eskimos) are good hunters and fishermen like Aborigines, but their country is different.'

The 'adversative' function of discourse particle balu lies in implying a wrong assumption on the part of the speaker (see ยง4.9.2 (ii)). Because it is directly speaker related it is used typically in conversation or first person narratives. In third person narratives it may occur in quotations of participants' utterances.

(658) Balu yundu minya dinda-nka, wrong 2sg.NOM(A) meat.ABS(O) roast-PURP but 2sg.NOM(A) bana-nga waju-l. water-LOC cook-NONPAST kari yundu 'I thought you intended to roast the meat, but you are boiling it in water.' (659) Balu nyulu kada-ny-baja.

wrong 3sg.NOM(S) come-PAsT-again 'I thought he was coming back (but apparently he did not).'

# 5.6 Concluding remarks

This chapter has looked at some aspects of Kuku Y alanji which, although used at sentence level, fulfil their function in the wider context of discourse; indeed, their function cannot be understood at the level of individual sentences. While this chapter has highlighted the discourse significance of certain parts of speech and syntactic devices, such as changing word order and reference strategies, it is by no means an analysis of Kuku Yalanji narrative as a genre. An investigation of Kuku Yalanji genres will require a different approach based on discourse theory and analytical methodology and is outside the scope of this descriptive grammar.
