b. Passive (0 > S)

1----

Ngayu juku-bu kuni-ji-ny. I sg.NOM(S) tree-INST hit-ITR-PAST 'I was hit withlby a tree.'

- (249) a. Nyunguny mili-bu 3sg.ACC(O) stinging.tree-INST burn-PAST 'A stinging tree burnt him.' waJu-ny.
	- b. Passive (O > S)

Nyulu mili-bu waju-ji-ny. 3sg.NOM(S) stinging.tree-INST burn-ITR-PAST 'He was burnt withlby a stinging tree. '

If there were a human or some other controlling agent responsible for the events in sentences (248) and (249), this agent would be stated and would appear in 'potent' ergative case in the transitive clause and in locative case in the passive clause. In the absence of an explicit agent the tree, or branch, in sentence (248) and the stinging tree in (249) are apparently still regarded as mere instruments of some force which, however, cannot be stated since it is not known. According to the 'chance' aspect of such agentless events the passive construction, which topicalises the patient, seems to be preferred by Kuku Yalanji speakers.

Now consider the passivisation of sentences (240) and (241) into (250) and (25 1) respectively:

- (250) N gayu murraja-mun-du / murraja-nga baka-ji-ny. 1sg.NOM(S) stonefish-*mun*-INST / stonefish-LOC poke-ITR-PAST 'I was poked by a stonefish.'
- (25 1) Nyulu mili-bu / mili-nga waju-ji-ny. 3sg.NOM(S) jellyfish-INST / jellyfish-LOC burn-ITR-PAST 'He was burnt by a jellyfish. '9

and:

(252) a. Jarba-bu nyunguny bayka-ny. snake-ERGIINST 3sg.ACC(O) bite-PAST 'A snake bit him. '

b. Passive

Nyulu jarba-nga / arba-bu bayka-ji-ny. 3sg.NOM(S) snake-LOC / snake-INST bite-ITR-PAST 'He was bitten by a snake.'

In sentences (250}-(252) it is possible to change the NP referring to stonefish, jellyfish or snake to locative in the passive, which indicates underlying agentive function, or to retain instrumental inflection (a choice which is not possible in (248) and (249)). Therefore it is ambiguous whether the respective NP in the corresponding transitive sentence is in fact in ergative or instrumental case. Only speakers' preferences, which are indicated by the order in which the choice of NPs in passive constructions is presented, would imply that stonefish and jellyfish are more 'instrumental' and snake is more 'agentive'.

<sup>9</sup> Mili is a homonym which refers to 'stinging tree' in (249) and to '(box)-jellyfish' in (241) and (251).

#### (ii) Dative

A NP in dative case (for forms of inflections see §3.2.2) has basically two distinct functions. The most common one is to comment on the reason why the action mentioned in the sentence core is performed. In the second function a dative NP sets a parameter with respect to which a certain action or state can be seen. Category 2 nouns take 'potent' or 'neutral' case inflection according to whether the referent is regarded as an active animate being as in (256b) and (26 1 ), or as an inanimate substance such as potential food as in (256a).

The broadly termed function of 'reason' is twofold again. One aspect of it is goal of a purposeful action (but not of a purposeful movement, which is expressed by locative). This includes an indirect beneficiary, i.e. someone for whom an action is performed so that he/she does not have to do it him/herself.<sup>10</sup> Complements of verbs like 'learn, teach' and the adjectival particle ‘want/like’<sup>11</sup> may also be included under goal.<sup>12</sup> Examples:

- (253) N gayu bubu kida-I-kida-l bayan-ka. 1 sg.NOM(A) ground.ABs(o) sweep-l-REDUP-NONPAST camp-DAT 'I am sweeping the ground for a camp. '
- (254) Nyulu Cooktown dunga-y yaba-nka. 3sg.NOM(S) Cooktown go-NONPAST eB-DAT:pt 'He goes to Cooktown for his elder brother. '
- (255) Bama-ngka nganya binal-bunga-l kuku-ku Aboriginal-ERG:pt(A) 1 sg.ACC(O) know-CAUS-NONPAST word-DAT

mayi-ka minya-ka bubu-ku bama-nka. plant.food-DAT flesh.food-DAT land-DAT Aboriginal-DAT:pt 'Aborigines teach me about [their] language, "bush-tucker", land [and] Aboriginal people. '

- (256) a. Ngayu kulngu-ku wawu jirray. 1 sg.NOM(S) bandicoot-DAT like much 'I like bandicoot a lot.' (i.e. to eat)
	- b. N gayu kulngu-nku wawu 1 sg.NOM(S) bandicoot-DAT:pt like 'I like [my pet] bandicoot a lot.' jirray. much

The other aspect of 'reason' is the (often indirect) cause for an action or emotion. This includes a general threat which may evoke an emotion as in (26 1) or something for fear of which something is done or not done as in (262) and (263). (If the threat is a direct one the ablative case is used; see (iv) below.) The aspect of 'cause' also includes the complement of a verb of utterance such as 'talk about' or 'ask for/about' as in (264).

Examples:

(257) Nyulu dingkar ngamu-nku badi-ny. 3sg.NOM(S) man.ABS(S) mother-DAT:pt weep-PAST 'The man cried because of his mother. ' (she had died)

<sup>12</sup> See Grimes (1975:121) “range”.

<sup>10</sup> See Beneficiary as defined by Blake (1977:35).

<sup>11</sup> For adjectival particles see §3.9.1.

- (258) Jana mayi nuka-l ngawa-nka. 3pl.NOM(A) food.ABS(O) eat-NONPAST baby-DAT:pt 'They are eating because of the baby.' (to celebrate the birth)
- (259) Ngali mayi-ka kuni-wa-y. 3du.exc.NOM(S) food-DAT hit-RECIP-NONPAST 'We two are fighting over food.'
- (260) N gayu wawurrwawurr-ma-ny bana-ka. I sg.NOM(S) glad-INcHO-PAST water-DAT 'I was glad about the water. ' (after a long dry walk)
- (26 1) Karrkay yinil kiju-nku. child.ABS(S) afraid crab-DAT:pt 'The child is afraid of crabs.' (they may nip)
- (262) N gayku babarr wawubaja-nga kari dunga-y bilngkumu-nku. I sg.POSS.ABS(S) eZ.ABS(S) river-LOC NEG go-NONPAST crocodile-DAT:pt 'My elder sister does not go to the river because of the crocodile.'
- (263) Ngayu wanarri-y kaya-nka kuli-ji-nka. I sg.NOM(S) run.REDUP-NONPAST dog-DAT:pt rage-COMIT-DAT 'I am running because of the vicious dog. '
- (264) Ngayu Mabel-anda babaji-ny bayan-ka jirakal-ka. 13 I sg.NOM(S) Mabel-LOc:pt ask.about-PAST house-DAT new-DAT 'I asked Mabel about her new house.'

(For syntactic details of constructions with this type of verb of utterance see §4.2.4.4.)

The parameter-setting function of dative is found in comparison-type constructions where a statement is made 'with respect to' a comparable or otherwise relevant factor. Examples:

- (265) N gawuya ngujay-ngka yalbay-bajaku. sea.turtle.ABS(S) freshwater.turtle-DAT big-very 'A sea turtle is a lot bigger than a freshwater turtle.' (i.e. compared to a freshwater turtle, a sea turtle is big)
- (266) Babi-ngka jarruka wubul baka-ny ngamu-nku. FM-ERG:pt(A) scrub.hen (egg).ABS(O) many'ABS(O) dig-PAST mother-DAT:pt 'Grandmother dug up a lot more scrub hen eggs than mother. ' (i.e. compared to mother, grandmother dug a lot).
- (267) Nyulu julmbanu yala maja bubu-ku 3sg.NOM(S) big.grey.kangaroo.ABS(S) like boss.ABS land-DAT

Australia-ka.

Australia-DAT

'The big grey kangaroo is like the boss of Australia. ' (i.e. with respect to Australia, the big grey kangaroo is like the boss)

<sup>13</sup> An inanimate complement of such a verb of utterance may be in locative case, e.g. bayan-ba 'house-LOC' , but dative is preferred, presumably because locative is already used for the addressee.

# 134 Chapter 4

## (iii) General locative

An NP in locative case (for forms of inflection see [§3.2.2](#page-3-2)) has a variety of functions which may be divided broadly into four categories: 'goa1' (in a different sense than conveyed by dative), 'intermediary', 'locality' and the purely syntactic function of case marker for the underlying A or O NP in a passive or antipassive construction. A category 2 noun takes ‘potent’ inflection if the referent is perceived as an animate being as in (270) and (271), but 'neutra1' inflection where it is interpreted as an inanimate entity such as for example food or a mere locality as in (269) and (276). 

Under the function of ‘goal’ we can list the goal of a purposeful movement and the addressee or receiver complement of a three-argument verb such as 'tell, show, ask, give'. Examples:

- (268) Nganjiny burrir-a mariji-ny. Ipl.exc.NOM(S) island-LOC swim-PAST 'We swam to the island.'
- (269) Warru-warru bikibiki-nga dunga-ny. yg.man-REDUP.ABS(S) pig-LOC go-PAST 'The young fellows went out for pigs.'
- (270) Charlie dunga-ny yarraman-anda. Charlie.ABS(S) gO-PAST horse-LOc:pt 'Charlie went to the horses.' (e.g. to feed them).
- (27 1) Ngayu minya milbi-l buji-nda. 1sg.NOM(A) flesh.food.ABS(O) show-NONPAST cat-LOC:pt 'I show the meat to the cat. '
- (272) Nyulu marrkin daji-ny yaba-nda. 3sg.NOM(A) gun.ABS(O) give-PAST eB-LOC:pt 'He gave the gun to his elder brother.'

A locative NP may denote the intermediary in the conveyance of something, for example:

(273) *Ngayu yunu mayi yunga-l* 1sg.NOM(A) 2sg.POSS.ABS(O) food.ABS(O) send-NONPAST ngayku-wun-bu ngamu-ndu. 1 sg-POSS-LOC mother-LOC:pt 'I will send your food with my mother.' 

(274) Maja-ngka kuku yunga-ny buliman-anda. bOSS-ERG:pt word.ABS(O) send-PAST police-LOC:pt 'The boss sent a message with the policeman. ' 

Any transitive or intransitive clause may include an optional locative NP to indicate where the action is taking place. Locative in this function conveys 'in, on, at' a particular place; it also marks a noun co-occurring with a location word such as 'under, behind, on top'. With proper names of places such as mangkal ‘Cedar Bay’, and dikarra ‘Thompson Creek’, locative inflection is optional. Examples: 

(275) Maral-maral bana-nga janji-l. girl-REDUP.ABS(S) water-LOC bathe-NONPAST 'The girls are bathing in the water.'

- (276) Charlie yarraman-ba bunda-yo Charlie.ABS(S) horse-LOC sit-NONPAST 'Charlie is sitting on a horse. ' ('horse' is seen as the location; cf. (270) where 'horses' show 'potent' inflection)
- (277) Dingar-angka kadar kuni-ny maja-nga. man-ERG:pt(A) wallaby.ABS(O) kill-PAST scrub-LOC 'The man killed a wallaby in the scrub.'
- (278) larba badabada juku-ngu wunana-y. snake.ABS(S) under log-LOC lie.REDUP-NONPAST 'A snake is lying under the log. '
- (279) Mary ngundu jana-y Queenie-nda. Mary.ABS(S) close.by stand-NONPAST Queenie-LOc:pt 'Mary is standing close to Queenie.'

The function of Locative in passive and antipassive constructions is discussed in §4.2.4.3 and §4.2.4.4.

#### (iv) Ablative

Ablative has the general function of implying a 'source', which in most of its manifestations coincides with a semantic 'former' (Grimes 1 975:133ff.). Specific aspects of this function are:

- (a) a locational or temporal starting point which has been left behind by the actor as in (280) and (28 1 );
- (b) the source of a possession as in (282);
- (c) the material from which something is made as in (283) and (284);
- (d) the cause of a physical state as in (285) (c.f. cause of emotion in dative case, e.g. (260), (26 1 » ;
- (e) a direct threat from which someone is trying to escape as in (286) and (287) (cf. indirect threat in dative case, e.g. (262), (263» .

A category 2 noun takes neutral inflection where it is interpreted as an inanimate body (284) and 'potent' inflection where it is regarded as a living and active being (287).

## Examples:

- (280) Kija jambul-muny ngayu dunga-y-baja Cairns-muny. moon two-ABL I sg.NOM(S) gO-NONPAST-again Cairns-ABL 'After two months I will leave Cairns.' (lit. go from)
- (28 1) lalbu-ngku kaya kanga-l bayan-muny. woman-ERG:pt(A) dog.ABS(O) chase-NONPAST house-ABL 'The woman chases the dog from the house.'
- (282) labuju-ngku mayi kari nuka-l babarr-andamuny. yB-ERG:pt(A) food.ABS(O) NEG eat-NONPAST eZ-ABL:pt 'A younger brother must not eat food from [his] elder sister.'
- (283) Jalbu-ngku balji wukurri-l jilngan-muny. woman-ERG:pt(A) bag.ABS(O) weave-NONPAST reed.grass-ABL 'The woman is weaving a bag from reed grass.'
- (284) Dingkar-angka belt balka-ny kurriyala-muny. man-ERG:pt(A) belt.ABS(O) make-PAST carpet.snake-ABL 'The man made a belt from the carpet snake.'
- (285) Ngayu bam bay minya-muny buyun-muny. I sg.NOM(S) sick meat-ABL bad-ABL 'I am sick from the bad meat. '
- (286) Nyulu ngaki-ji-y 3sg.NOM(S) hide-REF-NONPAST police-ABL:pt 'He is hiding from the police.' buliman-andamuny.
- (287) Jukijuki warri-n-warri-y kurriyala-ndamuny. chicken.ABS(S) run-n-REDUP-NONP AST carpet.snake-ABL:pt 'The chickens are running from the carpet snake.'

#### (v) Abessive

A NP in abessive case refers to a place from which an action is performed without the actor leaving this location. Location words are used more frequently in abessive case then nominals. (For location words see §3 .3 .2.) There is no 'potent' inflection for abessive, possibly because a noun in this case can only be interpreted as a location and not as a potentially active animate being. Examples:

| (288) | Mabel                                              | yirrka-y        | bayan-mundu.                 |
|-------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------|------------------------------|
|       |                                                    | Mabel.ABS(S)    | sing.out-NONPAST house-ABESS |
|       | 'Mabel is singing out from the house.' (cf. (281)) |                 |                              |
| (289) | Jana                                               | juku-mundu mayi | yilba-l.                     |

3pl.NOM(A) tree-ABESS fruit.ABS(O) throw-NONPAST 'They are throwing the fruit from the tree.'

#### (vi) Perlative

An NP in perlative case describes passage through a defined space. Apparently the distinction between locative and perlative is made only in Kuku Nyungkul. Kuku Yalanji uses locative for both functions. There is no 'potent' perlative inflection. (In sentences like 'the spear went through the wallaby' locative is preferred for 'wallaby'; perlative is accepted only with some misgivings.) Examples: --------------------------------

- (290) Yira yangka wala-ny bujil-darr miyil-darr. JUIce green.ant.ABS(S) enter-PAST nose-PERL eye-PERL 'Green ant juice entered through the nose and through the eyes.' (having been inhaled for the treatment of a cold)
- (29 1) Jana wawubaja-burr mariji-ny. 3pl.NOM(S) river-PERL swim-PAST 'They swam through the river. '

(292) Dingkar baral-darr dunga-n-dunga-y. man.ABS(S) road-PERL go-n-REDUP-NONPAST 'The man is going along the road. '

A perlative NP may take the place of a locative NP in a passive or antipassive construction in the appropriate context (see §4.2.4.3 and §4.2.4.4.)

## 4. 1.5 Nominal sentences

,----

Since there is no copula in Kuku Yalanji various types of verbless or nominal sentences are used.14 A nominal sentence resembles an intransitive sentence in structure in that it has a quasi-intransitive subject in absolutive or nominative case. This is followed by a non-verbal predicate giving the structure:

[NP1]s non-verbal Predicate

meaning: S is Predicate. 1S

The distinction between subject and predicate in nominal sentences depends entirely on stress and intonation pattern. The subject is characterised by final rising intonation and may, in careful speech, be separated from the predicate by a pause. The normal stress pattern shows clause stress on the final constituent of the predicate, except in a comparison involving a dative NP as in (302). Division into subject and predicate is indicated by --; where different segmentations are possible according to intonation these are indicated by (--) with corresponding translations.

The predicate may be:

(a) A NP in absolutive case. In these constructions the subject NP often involves a demonstrative, for example:

- (293) Nyulu yinya ngayku 3sg.NOM(S) that.ABS(S) 1sg.POSS.ABS yZ.ABS 'That one is my younger sister. ' jinkurr.
- (294) lungkalu yinya -- kami-nga. billycan.ABS(S) that.ABS(S) MMIFF-POSS 'That billycan is grandmother's.'
- (295) Yinya (--) mayi (--) ngulkurr. that.ABS(S) food.ABS(S) good(.ABS) 'That is good food.' OR 'That food is good.'

(b) A NP in locative case or a location word, for example:

(296) Kami -- bayan-ba. MMIFF.ABS(S) house-LOC 'Granny is in the house. ' (i.e. at home)

<sup>14</sup> See R. Hershberger (1979:70-72) 'Stative Clauses'. Note that the single constituent clauses included in her examples are only possible in anaphoric contexts where the subject NP is deleted. Note that her term "Benefactive" refers to my possessive.

<sup>15</sup> The distinction between 'topic' and 'comment' (see Hockett 1958) would be particularly appropriate for such nominal sentences, but since I employ 'topic' as a discourse term (see §5.3) I rather use 'subject' and 'predicate' in this section.

## 1 38 Chapter 4

- (297) Jana karrkay -- badabada. 3pl.NOM(S) child.ABS(S) down. there 'The children are down there.'
- (c) A NP in ablative case, for example:
	- (298) Ngayku ngamu -- kuna-muny. I sg.POSS.ABS(S) mother.ABS(S) Shiptons.Flat-ABL 'My mother is from Shiptons Flat.'
	- (299) Yinya (--) kuyu (--) jalun-muny. that.ABS(S) fish.ABS(S) sea-ABL 'That is fish from the sea' OR 'that fish is from the sea.'

Note that while the ablative form in a nominal sentence may have attributive function, i.e. 'fish from the sea' = 'sea fish', it cannot be regarded as a derived adjective since it does not allow further case inflections.

- (d) An adjective or numeral, for example:
	- (300) Nyungu kalka -- dudu. 3sg.POSS.ABS(S) spear.ABS(S) blunt 'His spear is blunt.'
	- (301) Ngayku kangkal -- kulur. 1 sg.POSS.ABS(S) own.child.ABS(S) three 'I have three children. '

This type of nominal sentence may include an optional dative NP to indicate comparison as for instance (265) or:

(302) *Ngayku kangkal* -- *yalbay nyungu-wun-ku kangkal-ka*. 1sg.POSS.ABS(S) *own.child.ABS(S) big 3sg-POSS-DAT own.child-DAT* 'My child is bigger than her child. '

(e) A comitative construction which may convey ownership, accompaniment or a characteristic (see §4.6.1 ), for example:

| (303) | Juku                          | ngakun --                     | nganka-ji.   |
|-------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------|
|       |                               | tree.ABS(S) flame.tree.ABS(S) | flower-COMIT |
|       | 'The flame tree has flowers.' |                               |              |

(304) Yundu maji-ji?16 2sg.NOM(S) match-COMIT 'Do you have any matches?'

(f) A privative construction which conveys the lack of something (see §4.6.2):

(305) Nyulu kiru-kari. 3sg.NOM(S) brain-PRIV 'He is stupid.'

<sup>16</sup> In nominal sentences with only two words like (304) and (305) there is no intonation distinction other than clause stress between subject and predicate.

- (306) Nyulu wulman -- mungka-kari. 3sg.NOM(S) old.man.ABS(S) hair-PRIV 'The old man has no hair.'
- (g) Walu 'face, appearance' plus a nominal which refers to personal appearance:
	- (307) Nyulu -- walu 3sg.NOM(S) face 'He is ugly.' nganJay. ugly
	- (308) Bama -- walu ngumbu. Aborigine.ABS(S) face dark 'Aborigines are dark(-skinned). '
- (h) Yala 'like' plus a noun phrase to express an approximation:
	- (309) N gayu karrkay -- yala Eileen-anga kangkal. I sg.NOM(S) child.ABS(S) like Eileen-POSS-ABS own.child.ABS 'I was a child like Eileen's child (about the same age).'
	- (3 1 0) Mili-nga karra -- yala cotton. jellyfish-POSS.ABS(S) string.ABS(S) like cotton.ABS 'The jellyfish's tentacles are like cotton.' (so fine)

Yala may co-occur with walu in apparently any order (see §3.9.2 (i)):

(3 1 1) Yinya dingkar -- yala walu kadar. that.ABS(S) man.ABS(S) like face wallaby.ABs 'That man looks like a wallaby. '

(i) An adjectival particle plus an optional NP in dative case (for adjectival particles see §3.9. 1 ):

- (3 1 2) a. Maral yinil. girl.ABS(S) afraid 'The girl is afraid.'
	- b. Maral yinil jarba-nka. girl.ABS(S) afraid snake-DA T:pt 'The girl is afraid of snakes.'
- (3 1 3) Kaya wawu bajibay-ngka. dog.ABS(S) want bone-DAT 'The dog wants a bone.'

# 4. 1.6 Order of sentence constituents

Every NP in Kuku Yalanji is clearly identifiable for its role by case marking, and therefore the order of sentence constituents is of no great importance unlike, for instance, in English, where word order is the primary means of recognising syntactic roles. Word order is in fact quite free in Kuku Yalanji as in most other Australian languages, although there is a certain preferred order of sentence constituents. This is S V for intransitive and A O V for transitive sentences. Peripheral and local extensions usually follow the verb but may stand anywhere in the sentence. Where a dative or locative NP is an immediate complement of a three-argument verb, e.g. (264), (27 1) and (272), or of an adjectival particle, e.g. (256), (3 1 2b), (3 1 3), it will usually be placed adjacent to this constituent, either before or after.

S V and A 0 V may be regarded as the unmarked word order. A change in word order which moves a constituent other than A or S to the front serves to topicalise this constituent. (For discourse-related word order see §5.4. 1 .) A basic rule which tends to override the preferred word order is that a pronoun is normally placed in the more prominent position, i.e. earlier in the sentence, than a noun. For instance, if a transitive sentence has a nonpronominal NP in A function and a pronominal NP in 0 function the pronoun is favoured over the noun in initial position as is illustrated for instance in (240), (241 ), (248) and (249). Since NPs can be split up it is also possible, and often occurs, that the pronominal component of a NP stands in an early position with the rest of the NP following somewhere towards the end as in (235). The reverse occurs only in 'reprise' constructions (see §5.4.1 ).

Temporal words, including interrogative 'when', usually occur in sentence-initial position, whereas there is no preference for the placement of location words and interrogative 'where' in an unmarked construction. A location word in conjunction with a locative NP normally precedes this NP but does not have to be immediately adjacent to it, e.g. (278) and (279).

Interrogatives 'who', 'what', 'which one', 'how many', 'how' and 'what kind' fill the slot of the particular constituent that the speaker enquires about, which may be anywhere in the sentence. Interrogative 'why' always occurs in initial position. (For interrogative words see §3.6.1; for further examples of questions see §4.8.)

#### 4.2 Clause-level derivations

In Kuku Yalanji we can distinguish two types of derivational processes, word-level derivations and clause-level derivations. As word-level derivations I consider those processes which change or add to the semantic content of a lexical item without, however, affecting the syntactic structure of a sentence, as for instance plural formation, 'personal characteristic' and 'degree' affixes, and verb reduplication. Verb concord with plural S, although not a word-level derivation in the above sense, also has no influence on syntactic structure. Such derivations have been discussed in §3.2.3 and §3.8.5.5.

A clause-level derivation, on the other hand, changes the syntactic structure in some minor or major way. Some of these derivations are optional while others are obligatory because of syntactic constraints on the surface structure of sentences. The following subsections discuss each clause-level derivation in turn, with a summary following in §4.2.5.

#### 4.2. 1 Inchoative constructions

�-------------------------------------.------

An inchoative construction optionally verbalises the nominal predicate in nominal sentences of types (a), (b), (d), (e), (f) and (i) described in §4.1 .5 above. Inchoative verbalisers -*ma-l*, attached to noun, adjective or adjectival particle, and -*maniji-y*, attached to a noun (see §3.8.5.3) change such quasi-intransitive sentences to true intransitive sentences of the structure:

$$[NP1]S \begin{cases} noun \\ adjective \\ particle \end{cases} -ma-l \text{ OR } (-maniji-y)$$
