# (8 1) Minya ngawuya jarra-kima minya-ka bulki-ka. meaLABS(S) sea. turtle. ABS(S) DEGl-soft meat-DAT cattle-DAT 'Sea-turtle meat is softer than beef. '

J arra- has also been attested with one verb, jarra-kulba-l 'carry' (kulba-l 'lift'), but it is not used productively with verbs.

#### (ii) -Baja (-ku) 'very'

The bound morpheme -baja has various functions. With verbs it is used as a postinflectional clitic meaning 'again' (see §3 . 1 0.3). With adjectives, on the other hand, it may be more appropriately classed as a stem-forming suffix for the following reasons. In connection with an adjective, -baja must always be followed by the emphatic clitic -ku (see §3. 1 0.2) to indicate 'very adjective', for example:

- (82) N gayu dakuy-baja-ku. I sg.NOM(S) hungry-DEG2-EMPHl 'I am very hungry.'
- (83) Ngawa kingkin-baja-ku. baby.ABS(S) cute-DE�-EMPHI 'The baby is very cute.'

If, however, an adjectival stem with -baja takes non-zero inflection, the inflectional suffix is inserted between -baja- and clitic -ku, for example:

| (84) | <i>Dingkar-angka junkurr-ji-baja-ngka-ku</i><br>man-ERG:pt(A) strength-COMIT-DEG2-ERG:pt(A)-EMPH1 |  |
|------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--|

| (85) | <i>Naavu iha-hadi-v karrkay-anka hambay-ho</i>                                                    |  |

(85) Ngayu jiba-badi-y karrkay-anka I sg.NOM(S) liver-cry-NONPAST child-DAT:pt 'I am sorry for the very sick child.' bambay-baja-nka-ku. sick-DEG2-DAT:pt-EMPH2

### 3.2.3.9 Co-occurrence of stem-forming affixes

The most productive of all stem-forming processes are possessive, cornitative, and general plural (reduplication). Adjectival stem formation with 'degree'-affixes is also fairly common, but all other stem-forming affixes have more limited application, partly because of their semantic content and partly because of formal criteria. For instance, 'kinship plural' -karra is used only with kinship terms and 'inhabitants' suffix -(w)arra can only occur on proper or common place names. Similar reasons proscribe the co-occurrence of derivations like 'plural' and 'pair'.

The catalytic suffix -mun- is used only with trisyllabic roots and loan words preceding the case inflection and therefore does not have to be included in ordering rules of stem-forming suffixes. The two prefixes also do not have to be ordered, since mala- 'expert' occurs only with noun roots andjarra- 'rather, more' attaches only to adjectival stems.

Of the stem-forming suffixes which occur with nouns only, 'privative', 'kinship plural', 'pair', 'inhabitants', and 'excessive' can be classed as first-order suffixes; reduplication for 'general plural' also falls into this category. All of these may be followed by comitative in 'accompaniment' function or possessive, or both, for example:

- (86) N gayu jilba dunga-y kangkal-kari-ji. Isg.NOM(S) walk go-NONPAST own.child-PRIV-COMIT 'I go for a walk with the childless one.'
- (87) lana kada-ny-baja ngamu-karra-ndamun-ji kambi-ji. 3pl.NOM(S) come-PAST-again mother-KPL-POSS-COMIT clothes-COMIT 'They came back with the mothers' clothes.'
- (88) lalbu-bulal-amu kangkal dubu-ngku ngaki-ny. woman-pair-poss.ABS(O) own.child.ABS(O) ghost-ERG:pt(A) steal-PAST 'A ghost stole the two women's children.'
- (89) Banabila-warra-mu kaya kuli-ji. (place name)-inhab-POSS.ABS(S) dog.ABS(S) rage-COMIT 'The Banabila-people's dogs are fierce.'
- (90) Kari dunga-y yinya-nji kamu-baka-nji. NEG go-IMP that-COMIT:pt a1cohol-excess-COMIT:pt 'Don't go with that drunkard!'
- (9 1) Maja balka-n-balka-wa-y warru-warru-nji. boss(master).ABS(S) talk-n-REDUP-RECIP-NONPAST yg.man-REDUP-COMIT:pt 'The boss is talking with the young men.'

A comitative stem in attributive function may also be followed by possessive:

(92) lalbu-mu waral-ji-mu dunyu wula-ny. woman-POSS.ABS(S) belly-COMIT-POSS.ABS(S) husband.ABS(S) die-PAST 'The pregnant woman's husband died.'

As was shown in §3.2.3.7 (i), an 'attributive' comitative stem referring to geographical features may take the 'inhabitants' suffix, for example:

ngalkal-ji-warra

'open forest country people'.

A comitative stem in 'accompaniment' function, on the other hand, cannot take further derivational suffixes, but such a comitative stem may be based on a possessive stem, as for instance in (87), and

(93) Nyulu warri-ny buliman-andamun-ji marrkin-ji. 3sg.NOM(S) run-PAST police-POSS-COMIT rifle-COMIT 'He ran [off] with the policeman's rifle.'

Note that possessive and privative apparently cannot co-occur. A sentence like 'he ran off without the policeman's rifle' would be paraphrased as 'he did not run off with the policeman's rifle', using a comitative form and negating the clause.

The adjectival 'degree' suffix -baja(-ku) may also be followed by further derivations, but such constructions are unusual, for example: .

- (94) Dingkar-amu yalbay-baja-mu-ku kalka kadaba-ny. man-POSS.ABS(S) big-DEG2-POSS.ABS(S)-EMPHI spear.ABS(S) break-PAST 'The very big man's spear broke.'
- (95) Nyulu dunga-ny car-mun-ji mukul-baja-ji-ku. 3sg.NOM(S) go-PAST car-mun-COMIT old-DEG2-COMIT-EMPHI 'He went with a very old car. '

Co-occurrence possibilities of nominal derivational suffixes are listed in Table 3 .4.

# 3.2.3. 10 Nominal compounds

Nouns and adjectives can be formed by compounding roots or stems, which often results in idiomatic expressions with extended semantic content. A compound is defined by inseparability and word-stress pattern (see §2.6.1 ).

Some compounds cannot be analysed synchronically, for example:

| marrka-bina | 'oyster found in mangrove swamp' ( <i>marrka</i> 'salt pan' in Kuku Yalanji, <i>bina</i> 'ear' in Djabugay, which may be a reference to the shape of the shell) |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| kalka-muku  | 'green tree snake' (lit. spear-back; this compound probably refers to the long and slender shape of the reptile)                                                |

More productive compounding processes include body-part terms, particularly miyil 'eye' and milka 'ear', for example:

| miyil-burra | 'blind' (eye-stale/bitter) |
|-------------|----------------------------|
| miyil-dudu  | 'illiterate' (eye-blunt)   |

| miyil-kaban-ji      | 'literate' (eye-letter/paper-COMIT)                      |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| miyil-wurril        | 'cross-eyed' (eye-lopsided)                              |
| miyil-wujurr-wujurr | 'dusk' (eye-darkness-REDUP)                              |
| milka-dudu          | 'deaf' (ear-blunt)                                       |
| milka-bujar         | 'homesick' (ear-raw/cold)                                |
| milka-marri         | 'contented, well adjusted' (ear-grown.up)                |
| milka-dandi         | 'good memory' (ear-hard)                                 |
| walu-dandi          | 'stubborn, disobedient' (face-hard)                      |
| mara-jalajala       | 'generous person' or 'clumsy person' (hand-loose/broken) |
| manu-buray          | 'squeamish feeling' (throat-spring.water)                |

The use of body-part terms in nominal and verbal compounds (see §3.8.S.2) with reference to personal attributes or mental states has also been attested for Guugu Yimidhirr (Haviland unpublished word list) and Djabugay (Patz, unpublished word list).

#### 3.2.4 Morphology of kinship terms

As was shown in §3.2.3.5 (ii) kinship terms differ from other nouns in that they take a special derivational suffix to indicate plural. A subset of seven kinship terms out of an attested total of 31 is further distinguished from other nouns in that they take case inflections and comitative suffixes from the 'neutral' set. These are: 

| kangkal  | 'own child'                    |
|----------|--------------------------------|
| manyarr  | 'wife'                         |
| babarr   | 'older<br>sister'              |
| jinkurr  | 'younger sister'               |
| biwul    | 'mother-in-law'                |
| ngalayan | 'father-in-law,<br>son-in-law' |
| kujiway  | 'daughter-in-law'              |

Of these, kangkal 'own child' always occurs with 'neutral' suffixes. With the other kinship terms 'neutral' suffixes are preferred, but 'potent' suffixes are possible, for example: 

| (96) | Kangkal-da(*-angka)       | kaya       | kuni-ny. |
|------|---------------------------|------------|----------|
|      | own.child-ERG(A)          | dog.ABS(O) | hit-PAST |
|      | '[My] child hit the dog.' |            |          |

- (97) Manyarr-dal-angka mayi waju-l. wife-ERGI-ERG:pt(A) food.ABS(O) cook-NONPAST 'The wife is cooking food.'
- (98) Ngayu dunga-y jinkurr-bul-undu. I sg.NOM(S) go-NONPAST yZ-LOO-LOC:pt 'I go to [my] younger sister. '
- (99) Nyulu kada-ny biwul-jil-unji. 3sg.NOM(S) come-PAST MiL-COMIT/-COMIT:pt 'She came with [her] mother-in-law. '

Other kinship terms allow only 'potent' suffixes, for example:

- ( 1 00) Dunyu-ngku(\*-bu) ngawa kuji-l-kuji-l. husband-ERG:pt(A) baby.ABS(O) look.after-REDUP-NONPAST 'The husband is looking after the baby. '
- (101) Ngayu yaba-nda(\*-nga) babaji-ny. I sg.NOM(S) eB-Loc:pt ask-PAST 'I asked [my] elder brother.'

In the Yalanji dialect the same kinship terms also prefer a possesslve suffix which is identical to the locative. inflection, for example:

kambi babarr-bal -amu 'elder sister's clothes' kambi kujiway-mbal-amu 'daughter-in-Iaw's clothes'

In the Nyungkul dialect, where the possessive suffix already coincides with allomorphs of the neutral locative inflection, there is no distinction between possessive stems of these kinship terms and other nouns, for example:

| kaya manyarr-anga | 'the wife's dog'      |
|-------------------|-----------------------|
| kaya biwul-ungu   | 'mother-in-law's dog' |
| kaya maral-anga   | 'the girl's dog'      |

# 3.2.5 Morphology of quantifiers

Kuku Yalanji has the basic two-term number system:

| nyubun | 'one' |
|--------|-------|
| jambul | 'two' |

There is a synonym mamarra 'two' which, according to my informants, is an "oldfashioned" or "stylish" form, but not a taboo language item. Although widely known, this term is not in general use.

Further quantifiers are:

| kulur      | 'a few, three'  |
|------------|-----------------|
| kanbal     | 'some, several' |
| wubul      | 'many'          |
| kankur     | 'half'          |
| yambayamba | 'everything'    |
| yamba-kari | 'nothing'       |

Kulur 'a few' now generally refers to cardinal number 'three' (see H. Hershberger & R. Hershberger 1 982), but it may also be used to imply an unspecified small number larger than two and smaller than kanbal 'some'. Two more derived number terms are:

| jambul-jambul | 'four (two-two)' |
|---------------|------------------|
| mara          | 'five (hand)'.   |

There are also two quantifiers which refer both to size and, by extension, to uncountable amounts. These are:

| buban  | '(a) little, insufficient' |
|--------|----------------------------|
| jirray | 'big, plenty, sufficient'  |

The following sentences illustrate the use of these two tenus in contrast to their counterparts kanbal and wubul:

- (102) a. Kambi ngayku kanbal. 'I have several [items of] clothes.'
	- b. Kambi ngayku buban. 'I have too few clothes/my clothes are insufficient.'
- ( 1 03) a. Ngayku bulawu kanbal. 'I have some flour. '
	- b. Ngayku bulawu buban. 'I have only a little flour. '
- ( 1 04) a. Bayan ngayku wubul. 'I have many houses.'
	- b. Bayan ngayku jirray. 'My house is big enough.'
- (105) a. Birra wubul juku-ngu. 'There are many [identifiable] leaves on the tree[s]
	- b. Birra jirray juku-ngu. 'There is a mass of leaves on the tree[s]' or: 'There are large leaves on the tree [ s]'

but c. Birra yalbay (bigllarge)juku-ngu.

can only mean 'There are large leaves on the tree(s)'.

As can be seen from the above examples the use of 'mass' quantifier versus 'countable' quantifier does not depend on the type of noun, but the semantic distinction is inherent in the quantifier. Consider also:

| bama wubul  | 'many people'             |
|-------------|---------------------------|
| bama jirray | 'a large crowd of people' |
| juku wubul  | 'many trees'              |
| juku jirray | 'a large forest'          |

Quantifiers have the same system of case inflections and derivational possibilities as other nominals. But they differ formally from nouns and adjectives in that they apparently take only 'neutral' suffixes. Furthermore, cardinal numbers one and two in the Nyungkul dialect, and one in the Yalanji dialect take case inflections and comitative and possessive suffixes that are different from those of other nominals. These suffixes are listed in Table 3.5.

Kulur 'a few, three' in the Nyungkul dialect takes these suffixes for ergative and ablative and, in free variation with regular nominal suffixes, also for dative and possessive. Comitative has the regular 'neutral' form -iji, i.e. kulur-iji (see Table 3 .3). Some speakers also use the cardinal number suffixes in free variation with regular suffixes for quantifier wubul 'many'.

Ergative, dative and locative inflections without initial vowel i are identical to the neutral allomorphs for these cases after y-final roots (see Table 3.1). It would therefore be possible that vowel i is in fact not part of the suffix, but part of a suppletive root ending in -iCy). Such an assumption would be supported by the fact that vowel i remains constant, whereas the suffix-final vowel in these inflections is a after root vowel i, according to the vowel-harmony rule. However, there is no other synchronic or diachronic evidence for suppletive trisyllabic roots of cardinal numbers. For this reason I interpret vowel i as part of the suffix and not as part of the root.

# 3.3 Morphology of location words

Location words in Kuku Yalanji belong to a closed word-class with different inflectional properties from those of nominals. A full list of attested location words is:

| wangkar        | 'upwards'                        |
|----------------|----------------------------------|
| wangkarwangkar | 'up there, above'                |
| bada           | 'downwards'                      |
| badabada       | 'down there, underneath'         |
| walmbi         | 'left'                           |
| jakuy          | 'right'                          |
| kungkarr       | 'north'                          |
| kuwa           | 'west'                           |
| jibarr         | 'south'                          |
| naka           | 'east'                           |
| yuba           | 'near'                           |
| ngundu         | 'close by'                       |
| kalakalbay     | 'far away'                       |
| wuyar          | 'on top'                         |
| ngubar         | 'on the other side of the river' |
| yiringkurr     | 'everywhere'                     |
| kudamundu      | 'behind'                         |
| yarra          | 'over there (general direction)' |

# 68 Chapter 3

Where semantically possible, location words may have temporal extension. Thus yuba and ngundu may be used in the sense of 'near' and 'close by in time', and kudamundu may mean 'afterwards'.

#### 3.3. 1 Locational systems

Three symmetrical locational systems are discernable in the above list of location words: up/down, left/right, and compass points. These and the general direction marker yarra will be discussed in the following subsections.

# (i) Wangkar 'up', bada 'down'

With respect to the surroundings of the settlement at W ujal W ujal on the Bloomfield River wangkar refers to 'up the river' and bada to 'down the river'. When indicating direction 'up a mountain' or a downward path other than along the river valley, the general direction marker yarra together with an appropriate gesture is used in connection with wangkar or bada. In an extended sense wangkar refers to a place or direction 'above speaker (in the air, in a tree, etc.)' and bada to a place 'below speaker (on the ground, under water, etc.)'.

# (ii) Walmbi 'left', jakuy 'right'

These terms have only limited use in Kuku Yalanji, applying apparently only to body parts. They generally occur as reduplicated comitative stems, for example:

| jakuy-jakuy-ji        | '(my) right side' |
|-----------------------|-------------------|
| jina walmbi-walmbi-ji | 'left foot'       |

By extension walmbi-walmbi-ji refers to a left-handed person.5

#### (iii) Compass points

Compass points play a most important part in orientation in Kuku Yalanji. As was mentioned above, the concepts left and right refer to the human body and are not used to indicate direction or location in the environment; this is done entirely by compass points and location words 'up/down'. In other words, a Kuku Yalanji speaker does not take his bearings subjectively with reference to his own person, but rather in relation to the objective and absolute concepts of north, east, south, and west. Where an English speaker would give directions as "turn left and then right", a Kuku Yalanji speaker would say, for instance, "tum west and then north". Similarly, the sides of a house are not referred to as "left" and "right" from the perspective of the speaker (which in English is often confusing for the listener), but a house has a "north side", an "east side", etc. according to its position in the actual environment. The following incident illustrates that Kuku Yalanji speakers always take their bearings from the environment. A woman was asked by her son to start the car while he was

<sup>5</sup> H. Hershberger and R. Hershberger (1 982) list common nouns for 'right hand' and 'right hand side', jurrubiji and malabayi respectively, but do not include a location term for 'right'. Jakuji (jakuy 'right' in my data) is glossed by them as 'left hand', but they concur with my data for location word walmbi 'left' and walmbiwalmbiji 'left-handed'.

trying to push it out of a bog. Not being a driver herself, she asked which pedal to press. She said: Pedal wanyu? Yarra naka, yarra kuwa? 'Which pedal? The eastern or the western one?'

An interesting aspect in the use of compass points in Kuku Yalanji is that they apparently only refer to places on land, but not the sea. Direction towards the sea, roughly east of Kuku Yalanji country, is described as simply jalun-bu 'sea-LOC" or dingal 'base (of tree), end', or also naka-dingal 'south-eastern end (of the land)'. Thus the compass points in Kuku Yalanji do not correspond exactly to a navigational compass, but indicate the following 'westwardshifted' directions:

| kungkarr | 'north/northwest' (e.g. Cedar Bay, Cooktown, Rossville) |
|----------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| kuwa     | 'northwest/west' (e.g. Hopevale, Laura)                 |
| jibarr   | 'southwest/south' (e.g. Mount Carbine, Mareeba)         |
| naka     | 'southeast' (e.g. Mount Pieter Botte, Cairns)           |

There are cognates in Guugu Yimidhirr and Yidiny corresponding to the general directions indicated by the Kuku Yalanji terms. However, in Guugu Yirnidhirr we can distinguish between roots, gungga-, guwa-, dyiba-, naka-, and five sets of locative/allative forms varying in reference to relative distance; e.g. a place a long way to the North would be gunggaalu, a place just to the North is gunggaarra, etc. The Kuku Yalanji terms, which do not make these distinctions, resemble the stem forms that are used in derived inchoative verbs in Guugu Yimidhirr: gunggaarr=mal, guwa=mal, dyibaarr=mal, naga=mal. Djabugay has cognates gunggarri 'north', djiwarri 'south', guwa 'west' (but djilnggu for 'east').

# (iv) General direction yarra

Yarra expresses no specific directional reference in itself. It may occur with other location words or nouns in locative case and implies 'over there in the direction of X'. When used on its own it is always accompanied by a gesture of hand or head towards the direction referred to (see also deictic yarra 'there, yonder' in Guugu Yimidhirr, and suffix -djirra 'towards' in Djabugay).

# 3.3.2 Location words - inflections

Location words occur only in local cases. They differ formally from nouns in that the root itself implies locative (with the function of 'location at' or 'direction towards') and therefore does not take locative case inflection. Perlative 'through' apparently cannot be used with location words since they do not define a space that can be traversed, but refer to a more general location.

Wangkar 'up', and bada 'down' distinguish between 'location' and 'direction' in their rootor stem-form. The simple root implies direction, e.g. bada 'downwards', and the reduplicated stem implies location, e.g. badabada 'down there, underneath'. Both simple and reduplicated forms may take further local inflections.

The inflectional system and forms for location words are:

| locative | ∅      |                                 |
|----------|--------|---------------------------------|
| ablative | -muny  | (=‘neutral’ nominal inflection) |
| abessive | -mundu | (= nominal inflection)          |

70 Chapter 3

Some examples of location words in different cases are:6

- (1 06) Buliman-angka ngayku nganjan naka police-ERG:pt(A) 1 sg.POSS.ABS(O) f ather.ABS(O) east.LOC 'The police took my father "Cairns-way".' (i.e. south-east) wundi-ny. take-PAST
- ( 107) Mary ngundu jana-y Queenie-nda. Mary .ABS(S) close. by .LOC stand-NONP AST Queenie-LOC:pt 'Mary is standing close to Queenie. '
- (1 08) Nyulu kada-ny ngubar-muny. 3sg.NOM(S) come-PAST other.side.of.river-ABL 'He came from the other side of the river. '
- ( 1 09) N gayu wulngku kalakalbay-mundu I sg.NOM(A) song.ABS(O) far.awaY-ABESS nyaji-l. hear-NONPAST 'I hear a song from a long way away.'
- ( 1 1 0) Bama yirrka-n-yirrka-y badabada-mundu. Aborig.ABS(S) shout-REDUP-NONPAST down.there-ABESS 'People are singing out from down there.'

The location word kudamundu 'behind' could be a fossilised abessive form, although kuda cannot be analysed in this context. (The form -kuda is otherwise used as temporal clitic, meaning something like 'meanwhile'; see §3.l0.1 and §5.2.2.) Note that kudamundu can take ablative but not abessive inflection, for example:

- ( 1 1 1) Wulbuman-angka nyunguny wukurri-ny kudamundu(\*-mundu). old.woman-ERG:pt(A) 3sg.ACC(O) follow-PAST behind.LOC(\*ABESS) 'The old woman followed him. ' OR ' ... followed from behind.'
- (1 1 2) Warru jalama-ny juku-muny kudamundu-muny. yg.man.ABS(S) jump-PAST tree-ABL behind-ABL 'The young man jumped [out] from behind the tree.'

#### 3.4 Morphology of time words

Words with temporal reference belong to a separate word class in Kuku Yalanji that is distinguished from both nouns and location words by its morphology. Also, time words do not co-occur with nominals but constitute phrases in their own right. The members of this word class are:

| nyiku       | 'now, today'                  |
|-------------|-------------------------------|
| yilaybaja   | 'later on today'              |
| yilay-yilay | 'late afternoon'              |
| wunkuny     | 'next day, tomorrow'          |
| juma        | 'eventually, soon, next time' |
| yilayku     | 'yesterday'                   |
| ngadiy-     | 'a long time'                 |

Locative, which has zero inflection, is glossed in this section only, but not in any further examples or texts.
