#### 1.1 The language and its speakers

#### 1. 1. 1 Kuku Yalanji and surrounding languages

The Kuku Yalanji language is spoken in the south-eastern coastal region of the Cape York Peninsula of North Queensland, Australia (see Map 1 ). The language name can be analysed as 'the language with "this'" (kuku 'word, language', yala-nji 'this-COMIT' ; see §3.2.3.3).I

To the north and south along the Pacific coast Kuku Yalanji is bordered by genetically related languages Guugu Yimidhirr and Dyabugay respectively. On the basis of cognates and particularly of grammatical features one can say that Kuku Yalanji is more closely related to Guugu Yimidhirr than to Dyabugay. Reference to these languages will be made throughout this study, as well as to Yidiny, south of Dyabugay. Genetically, Yidiny and Dyabugay are probably equally close relations of Kuku Yalanji, but because of the greater geographical distance there would have been less areal influence and diffusion between Yidiny and Kuku Yalanji.

Languages in the north-west to south-west of Kuku Yalanji are of a quite different linguistic type. These are: Gugu Warra, Gugu Mini and Mbabaram, an initial-dropping language (see Map 1).

The concept of 'own language' as distinct from 'other languages' is an important aspect of tribal identity in Australia, as indeed it is for any nation in the world. Thus Aborigines distinguish their own language from that of another tribal group, even if the differences are only slight, sometimes represented by just a few different lexical items. Accordingly, a tribal name is often derived from the language name in Australia, whereas the reverse is seldom encountered (see Dixon 1 980:3 3-43).

It is not uncommon in Australia that a language name is based on a certain linguistic feature of the language (Dixon 1 980:41-42). Guugu Yirnidhirr, north of Kuku Yalanji, also means 'the language with "this'" (yimi 'this').

Where the self-termed 'languages' of several tribes are mutually understandable, the linguist may recognise these as dialects of one superordinate language. But "there was not usually any name for a group of tribes whose speech was mutually intelligible, nor for the language2 [the superordinate language] that we can - on linguistic criteria - assign to them. It is necessary to choose some label for each language2, and this usually has to be done fairly arbitrarily by the linguist" (Dixon 1 980:43).

Map 1: Kuku Yalanji and its neighbours

Kuku Yalanji has been adopted as the cover term for a language that had about a dozen dialects of which all but two are now extinct or known only to a handful of elderly speakers. The Kuku Yalanji dialect, spoken east of the Great Dividing Range (see Map 2, see § 1 . 1 .3), is one of the two remaining dialects with a viable speech community and its name was originally chosen by Oates and Oates (1 964a) to refer to the eastern dialects of this language group. I extend the reference of this language name to include the western dialects, one of which is also termed Kuku Yalanji by its few remaining speakers. Positive identification and geographical placement of the dialects of Kuku Yalanji is difficult for the following three reasons. Firstly, the name by which speakers refer to their own dialect is not always the same as the term used for it by other communities. Secondly, members of a tribal subgroup may use their territory term as identification (i.e. 'inhabitants of'), which does not necessarily imply a dialect difference. Thirdly, because of the continuous shifting about and intermingling of members of different tribal groups, enforced by European administration over several generations, it may be difficult to ascertain where a particular dialect was originally spoken. Previous research has identified thirteen different dialects for Kuku Yalanji which partly overlap in territory. A full list of these dialects is given in Table 1.1. Data has been collected for those dialects marked (\*) in the second and third columns. Map 2 shows the approximate location of these dialects. Several of the dialect names comprise the term kuku (koko) 'word, language' plus presumably a characteristic of the language indicated by the comitative suffix -ji (see §3.2.3.3). However, only two of these are analysable: Kuku Yalanji (see §1.1.1 ) and Kuku Buyunji 'language with bad' or 'bad language'. Other terms cannot be analysed, but it appears that Jungkurara (Tindale column, corresponding geographically to Kuku Tyunkay in Dixon column) may have a territory name as its basis. The ending -ara could well represent the derivation -warm 'inhabitants of' (see §3.2.3.7, and § 1 .2.1.1 'Tribal groups and names'). Possibly, this name does not actually refer to a different dialect (the data for Kuku Tyunkay is in fact identical to that for Muluridyi), but evidence is too scanty to allow a firm decision on this point.

The correspondence in territory for Kuku Buyunji and Yalanji is an example of different terms employed for the same dialect by different groups. Western self-termed Kuku Yalanji speakers (see Brady, Anderson, Rigsby column) refer to the eastern dialect as Kuku Buyunji,2 whereas eastern speakers definitely call their language Kuku Yalanji and refer to the western dialect around Maytown/Palmer River as Kuku Yalaja (see Anderson 1 979:36).

<sup>2</sup> Haviland (1 979a:29) states that Guugu Yimidhirr speakers use the term Gugu Buyun 'bad language' for an "intermediate dialect with lexical and syntactic affinities to both Guugu Yimidhirr to the North and Gugu Yalanji to the South", that was spoken along the Annan River and was apparently "regarded with disdain by their neighbours".

Table 1.1 : Attested dialects of Kuku Yalanji

H. Hershberger and R. Hershberger ( 1 982) call Kuku Jalunji the "Bloomfield dialect", thus placing it in the territory of Kuku Buyunji or eastern Kuku Yalanji. According to my data, this "dialect", which is spoken by the original seashore inhabitants (jalun-ji 'with sea'), differs from the neighbouring dialects only in that it contains words for maritime fauna and flora that are unknown to speakers living a little further inland. No definite information could be obtained from speakers as to whether Jalunji was actually regarded as "different talk"; but whatever the case may be, Jalunji people were confined to the narrow coastal strip and the term cannot apply to the dialect of the Bloomfield River.

A vailable data, which is only scanty for some dialects, shows that the dialects of Kuku Yalanji are very similar, sharing between over 70% and over 90% of common vocabulary and agreeing closely in morphology·8

The eastern Kuku Yalanji dialect and Kuku Nyungkul, from now on referred to as Yalanji and Nyungkul, are the subject of investigation of this study. (I do not use the name Kuku Buyunji since that is not what the speakers call themselves.) Yalanji and Nyungkul have over

> Tindale also includes a dialect called Wakaman in his map for an area extending a great deal further south than the approximate boundary given by Dixon's informants. According to Sutton ( 1 976a: 1 1 6), Tindale's data corresponds to that of the initial dropping language Agwamin and is clearly not a dialect of Kuku Yalanji. Apparently, the name Wakaman was used by different informants for different languages (see Sutton 1 976a and Dixon field notes).

90% of common vocabulary and show only minor morphological differences. Because of the attested close similarity between the dialects of Kuku Yalanji, the linguistic details described here may be taken to apply to the Kuku Yalanji language. Example sentences, unless otherwise indicated, are given in the Yalanji dialect and special mention is made of morphological differences in Nyungkul.

# 1. 1.3 Territory

Speakers of the Kuku Yalanji language traditionally inhabited an area of over 2000 sq km extending from the Mossman River in the south to the Annan River in the north, bordered by the Pacific Ocean in the east and extending inland to presumably just west of Mount Mulgrave (see Map 2). Three ecological zones may be distinguished in this region: open woodland, dense rainforest and coastal plains.

To the west of the Great Dividing Range there is mostly flat to hilly country with open woodland and grass vegetation. Although there are a number of larger rivers such as the Palmer, Mitchell and Saint George Rivers with their tributaries, these rivers are mostly seasonal and may dry up to only a few waterholes in the dry season. Nevertheless, in precontact times this area would have been able to support a fair number of people with good resources of game, fish and plant food.

The eastern slopes of the Great Dividing Range leading down to the Pacific coast are extremely rugged and covered with dense rainforest containing a multitude of permanent springs, creeks and rivers, which provide a reliable water supply and fish resources. Game and plant food were also abundant in the rainforest region. For the most part the slopes descend steeply right to the ocean front, creating a continuous chain of small bays with narrow sand beaches.

More extensive coastal plains exist on the mouths of the larger rivers, e.g. the Bloomfield River and Daintree River. Here the vegetation consists largely of coastal thicket and mangrove swamps. The coastal waters and estuaries had plentiful and reliable resources of fish and other edible maritime fauna, and coastal vegetation also provided some plant foods. These coastal plains and the adjacent gradually narrowing river valleys were apparently heavily populated in pre-contact times, as may be inferred from Hughes' list ( 1 886) of no less than ten tribal groups in Weary Bay at the mouth of the Bloomfield River.

The Yalanji and Nyungkul groups traditionally inhabited the rainforest terrain (see Map 3) in which the present Wujal Wujal Community is situated.

### 1.1.4 Present speakers

The devastating effect of the Palmer River gold rush late last century very quickly decimated the Kuku Yalanji tribes west of the Great Dividing Range to such an extent that several of them are now extinct. It is difficult to estimate the number of remaining speakers of any western dialect, since they are widely dispersed over an area from Mareeba to Cooktown, Kuranda, Chillagoe, Mossman and the Bloomfield River. Others have been resettled at Yarrabah or Palm Island. Three elderly speakers that I briefly consulted were very proficient in their language (western Kuku Yalanji) but bemoaned the fact that the younger generations are on the whole ignorant of the language of their forebears. There is certainly nothing remotely like a 'speech community' for any of the western dialects.

Map 3: Nyunkul and Yalanji Territory

Eastern Yalanji and Nyungkul are still spoken by about 300 speakers (Schmidt 1 990). Owing to the ruggedness and inaccessibility of their territory they remained largely unaffected by the violence accompanying early European intrusion and have managed to maintain many aspects of their culture and particularly their language. A number of Yalanji and Nyungkul speakers now live at Mossman, but the majority are concentrated in the Bloomfield River valley. There are slightly more Nyungkul than Yalanji speakers and there is also a very small proportion of Bidiji, Yalaji and Guugu Yimidhirr speakers in this area.

Language consciousness and maintenance on the Bloomfield River was boosted by the introduction, in the late 1 970s, of a vernacular literacy program in Kuku Yalanji. The program was developed by the SIL missionary linguists H. Hershberger and R. Hershberger and taught by them, assisted by Aboriginal teacher aides, at the Bloomfield River State School until their departure in 1 985. Aboriginal assistant teachers have been teaching Kuku Yalanji as a Language Other Than English (LaTE) from preschool to year 7 until recently when the program was reduced to begin in year 3. Not only Aboriginal children - in 2001 about 85% of the student population - but also non-Aboriginal children take part. The teaching material is based on the Hershbergers' program, but the school has been updating and revising the material (see Harms et al. 1 997). The Mossman High School, too, includes Kuku Yalanji in its LaTE program for Grade 8 students. It appears that within the constraints of available funding both schools are contributing a great deal towards the maintenance of Kuku Yalanji and its associated culture. However, with two half-hour lessons per week in the primary school program the impact cannot be very strong.

By 1 981, according to my observations, the main language of communication among Aborigines at Wujal Wujal was KukuYalanji and Kuku Nyungkul. The same seemed to apply, at least among the adult population, when I visited the community briefly in 1 990. However, even 20 years ago several parents expressed their view that it would be advantageous for their children's school education to speak English in the home. They therefore did not want to enforce the speaking of Kuku Yalanji in the family. Apparently this trend has continued; a Bloomfield River State School teacher reported in 1 993 that children understood Kuku well, but many were less competent at speaking it. In 200 1 Norman Tayley, Wujal Wujal Community Council member and assistant teacher, confirmed that the use of Kuku in the home had further decreased, that it was hardly used in the community's kindergarten and that consequently the children did not have a proper grasp of the language.

A form of creole is also in use. Typical creole features that I noticed were: suffix -im on English transitive verb roots, e.g. put-im, chuck-im; suffix -bala on adjectives, e.g. that deadbala 'that dead person',jlash-bala 'distinguished' (a slightly derogatory term); blonga or bla 'to indicate possession', e.g. car blonga/bla Cedric 'Cedric's car'; and lexical items too much and big mob for 'a lot', savvy for 'know'.9 For some older speakers the creole is the only way to communicate with white Australians.

## 1. 1.5 Studies of KukuYalanji

Cursory investigations of several dialects obviously belonging to KukuYalanji have been preserved from the period of European settlement between the 1 870s and about 1 900. Word

<sup>9</sup> For a detailed discussion of Cape York Creole, see Crowley and Rigsby ( 1979).

lists varying in length and quality are available for tribes living around the headwaters of the Hodgkirison, Mitchell and Walsh Rivers, presumably speakers of Wakura (Richards 1 924; Mowbray 1 886; Davidson 1 886). Vocabularies from the inhabitants of Weary Bay and the Bloomfield River valley were collected by Hislop ( 1 899), Hughes (1 8 86) and missionary Hoerlein (unpublished, presumably around 1 900). Hislop, one of the first settlers in the Bloomfield River valley and a sensitive observer of the Aborigines (see Roth 1 901-1905) provided an excellent word list which agrees closely with the present data for Yalanji and Nyungkul. Hoerlein's vocabulary with about 550 entries is also of good quality and concurs with present data from the area.

Schmidt, in his Die Gliederung der Australischen Sprachen ( 1 919), used Hislop and Hughes as sources, calling the language Bulponarra, which is the first of the ten names for Weary Bay tribes recorded by Hughes. (Lanyon-Orgill 1 962 gives a list of fifty words of the Bulponara language, allegedly collected prior to 1 80 1 ; however, like much of Lanyon-Orgill's other work, this is probably a hoax.)

Except for some brief investigation of an inland dialect by Tindale in the 1 930s, no further research of the Kuku Yalanji language was undertaken for almost sixty years. Hale, Dixon, and Laycock and Dixon collected some material on several dialects in the early 1 960s (see Table 1. 1 ).

In the late 1 960s and early 1 970s some material of "Gugu-Bujun and Related Languages" and "Kantyu and Koko-Yalandji" was collected and described by N. Holmer and published in 1 988. Holmer's description and analysis of the data contains errors, inconsistencies and unsupported statements. Only a few examples will be given here; for more detail see Dixon ( 1 992). In his chapter 'Gugu Buyun and related languages' Holmer (1988:38) describes in very broad but basically accurate terms the vowel-harmony rules applying in Kuku Yalanji (see §2.5.1). Later, in his chapter 'Kantyu and Koko-Yalandji' he describes the same vowel-harmony rule but extends it to monomorphemic words and explains "the appearance of -i for expected -a" as being "due to the phonetics of Queensland English" (Holmer 198 8 :65). He includes a retroflex stop and retroflex nasal in the consonant system, neither of which in fact exists in Kuku Yalanji (see §2. 1 . 1 ). His classification of locative suffix allomorph -ba as a "postposition" is unsupported ( 1 988 :39, 66) and his identification of stem-forming suffixes "personal-man" and "feminine -gan" is wrong. In short, Holmer's comments do not contribute to the understanding of Kuku Yalanji.

Detailed investigation of Yalanji and Nyungkul began in 1 961 with H. Hershberger and R. Hershberger of the Summer Institute of Linguistics. Between 1 964 and 1 982 they published sketches of the following aspects of Yalanji/Nyungkul: pronouns, nominal and verbal morphology, structure of noun phrases, clauses and sentences, two clitics, stress patterns (all using the tagmemics approach). Several of these publications had been prepared after only six months of fieldwork and are inevitably sketchy and subject to some misinterpretations. In 1 982, with considerably more familiarity with the language, a twoway dictionary appeared with close to 2000 entries, some example sentences and a very brief non-technical grammatical outline. In 1 985 their translation of the New Testament was published.

W. Oates and L. Oates (1964), also of SIL, published notes on phonology, pronouns and cultural background, as well as a two-way vocabulary with about 1000 entries, apparently after only two months of research. The quality of the vocabulary leaves something to be desired, particularly the representation of verbs, which are often listed not as roots but indiscriminately in different inflectional forms. In 1 992, L. Oates published a Kuku Yalanji

dictionary based on the Oates 1 964 vocabulary, the Hershberger dictionary and "two handwritten word lists by Norman Baird", Aboriginal Assistant Teacher at Bloomfield River State School. The dictionary, arranged by semantic fields, is apparently designed for teaching purposes. It includes instructions on morphology and grammar and sample sentences, many of which are taken from Hershberger's translation of the New Testament.

A detailed discussion of suffix -ji was undertaken by 1. A. Ware in 1981 for a MA thesis at North Texas State University. Based on Oates and early Hershberger data Ware argues that -ji, both as nominal and as verbal suffix, is basically a stative marker. While some functions of verbal suffix -ji support this notion when seen in the context of transitivity hierarchy, the range of functions is much more complex (see §3.8.5.4 (ii) and §4.2.4). But more importantly, verbal -ji and nominal -ji, which is just one allomorph of the comitative suffix (see §3.2.3.3), are not the same suffix. Ware's analysis apparently suffers from the limitations of the data available to her.

The work by Hershberger and Oates prior to 1 982 was used as a starting point for this study and has been amended where indicated.

My own investigation of the Yalanji and Nyungkul dialects is based on about 10 hours of recorded texts (85 texts from one to fifteen minutes in length) and about 19 hours of recorded elicited material; further elicitation was taken as notes but not recorded on tape. (Tapes and written material are deposited with the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies in Canberra.) Further insight into the language was gained from listening to and taking part in casual conversations.

Almost all of my data was gathered from speakers of the Wujal Wujal community where I spent about ten months of fieldwork on four visits during 1 979-8 1, becoming an active participant in community life. A small portion of data was collected from Yalanji and Nyungkul speakers living in Mossman and from a speaker of an inland dialect, presumably Kuku Yalaja, living at Mareeba.

In the Wujal Wujal community I worked mostly with a permanent group of five Yalanji and Nyungkul speakers in the age group between 45 and 65. These speakers proved to be most reliable both in their linguistic competence and ability to express language intuitions, and in their wealth of traditional knowledge.

#### 1.2 The culture of the Kuku Yalanji

It can be assumed that there was reasonable cultural homogeneity in the area specified for the KukuYalanji language (see Anderson 1 980:78). However, post-contact history took a dramatically different course in the western and eastern parts of this territory and first-hand information on cultural background is almost exclusively confined to the eastern speakers of KukuYalanji who represent a still largely intact community.

## 1.2.1 Cultural background

This subsection can be no more than a cursory account of some aspects of Kuku Yalanji culture. Unless otherwise indicated, the details presented here are based on personal information from members of the Yalanji and Nyungkul community. (For more detailed discussions of social and particularly economic patterns see Anderson 1 979 and 1980.)
