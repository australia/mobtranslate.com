(h) A nominal or pronominal possessive form may precede or follow a noun. An optional modifier (g) may be included after the head noun, for example:

| badur ngamu-mu              | (fishing.line mother-POSS) | 'mother's fishing line' |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------|
| ngayku bayan (yalbay)       | (1sg.POSS house big)       | 'my (big) house'        |
| kalka (jirakal) dingkar-amu | (spear new man-POSS)       | 'the man's (new) spear' |

(i) An inalienably possessed part may stand in apposition to the head noun (see §4.5.2), for example:

nyulu dukul 'he [his] head'

The possessed part always follows the possessor; optional modifiers refer to the thing possessed, for example:

nyulu dukul yalbay 'he [his] big head'

Noun phrases of the last type may be analysed as consisting of two heads in the relationship of "inclusion apposition" as defined by Quirk et al. (1 972:637). It refers to "cases of apposition where the reference of the first appositive is not identical with that of the second, but rather includes it". The same analysis can be applied to generic/specific noun NPs (type (c)) and pronoun/noun NPs where the pronoun implies a greater number of referents than the noun as in yubal Coraleen 'you two (one of you) Coraleen (i.e. you and Coraleen)" or jana Ivy 'they (one of them) Ivy (i.e. the Ivy mob)'. 1

#### 4. 1.2 The verb complex

The core constituent of the verb complex is a simple or compound verb such as kida-l 'scrape', nyunba-y 'tum back', warngku-wuna-y 'sleep', maku-nyaji-l 'meet'. The verb may be accompanied by a non-inflecting modifier which normally precedes the verb but may also follow it. Verbal modifiers can be:

(a) an adverbial particle (see §3 .8.6.1 ), for example:

| kanban kuni-l | 'hit by mistake' |
|---------------|------------------|
| walku dunga-y | 'walk past'      |

(b) a derived adverb (see §3.8.6.2), for example:

| kiray-ku wukurri-l | (secret-ADV follow)  | 'follow secretly' |
|--------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| kuli-ji-ku kuni-l  | (rage-COMIT-ADV hit) | 'hit viciously'   |

Verb complexes with more than one modifier have not been attested.

### 4. 1.3 Verbs - syntactic types

Kuku Yalanji distinguishes strictly between tranSItive and intransitive verbs. An intransitive verb requires only a noun phrase in subject function, which can be either a pronoun in nominative case or a nominal in absolutive case. The subject of an intransitive verb may be either animate or inanimate.

See also the interpretation of "apposition noun phrase" by R. Hershberger ( 1 964a:3 8).

### 1 22 Chapter 4

A transitive verb has to be accompanied by two core syntactic noun phrases. These are one noun phrase in agent function, which may be a pronoun in nominative case or a nominal in ergative case, and one noun phrase in object function, which may be a pronoun in accusative case or a nominal in absolutive case. In a context-related sentence either of the core syntactic noun phrases may be omitted, leaving the verb as sole clause constituent (e.g. text 36, lines 39, 42 and 45).

In Kuku Yalanji the transitivity value of a verb in a transitive sentence is not affected according to whether the action is performed by an animate or inanimate actor.2 An inanimate actor receives instrumental case marking to indicate that the action is uncontrolled and non-volitional as in examples (222) and (223). Chance actions by potentially controlling agents, on the other hand, may be expressed by passive constructions involving an intransitivised verb (see §4.2.4.3).

- (222) Karrkay mili-bu child.ABS(O) stinging. tree-INST 'A stinging tree burnt the child. ' waJu-ny. bum-PAST
- (223) Nganya juku-bu baka-ny. I sg.ACC(O) stick-INST poke-PAST 'A stick poked me.' (e.g. when I sat on the ground)

Because 'neutral' ergative and instrumental are identical in form, the syntactic function of the inanimate actor in such a sentence is ambiguous on first sight. This problem is considered further in §4.1 .4.4 (i).

### 4. 1.4 Case functions

In §3.2.2 the forms of case inflections were presented with only brief indication of their functions. This section will examine in detail the syntactic and semantic functions of cases in Kuku Yalanji.

### 4. 1.4.1 Preliminary remarks

This study is mainly concerned with providing a pragmatic formulation of Kuku Yalanji grammar and therefore uses the overt case form as a basis for the definition of 'case'. An analysis based solely on case roles according to syntactic-semantic relationships3 would appear impracticable before formal characteristics of Kuku Yalanji cases have been established. However, while using this starting point, I also pay close attention to case functions and will distinguish two cases such as Ergative and Instrumental, although they have the same form, because there are pressing syntactic reasons for doing so. On the other hand, there is the necessity to distinguish four core syntactic cases on formal grounds: ergative and absolutive for nouns and nominative and accusative for pronouns. The functions of these overlap in the following way:

3 See for instance Fillmore ( 1 968); A. Hale ( 1973); Foley (1980).

<sup>2</sup>  A similar situation obtains in Guugu Yimidhirr (Haviland 1 979a: 125). In Yidiny (Dixon 1 977a:275) and Djabugay (patz 1991 :297-298) an inanimate agent requires a verb with derivational suffix -:di-n and -yi respectively, but the verb remains transitive.

![](_page_2_Figure_1.jpeg)

Such a split case-marking system is a common phenomenon in Australian languages and it has become a firmly established convention to distinguish the functions of the respective cases as:

- A transitive subject (or Agent)
- S intransitive subject
- o transitive object

(see Dixon 1 972:xxii; Silverstein 1 976: 1 1 2). Since the case forms of nouns and pronouns do not correspond with these functions in a one-to-one relationship, one cannot simply adopt the functional labels as case labels, even though the functions, and not the cases, are of primary syntactic importance. I therefore gloss core syntactic nouns and pronouns with both the case and functional label; e.g. NOM(S) denotes a nominative pronoun in intransitive subject function, ABS(O) a noun in absolutive case and in transitive object function, etc. This may appear cumbersome, but I regard it as necessary for the following reasons: (a) all constituents of a noun phrase must have the same case function; and (b) only noun phrases with the same case function may be conjoined. If nominal and pronominal constituents of the same noun phrase or of conjoined noun phrases are glossed only with their respective case labels the identical function cannot be obvious, but the functional terms A, s and 0 will disambiguate the syntactic structure.

# 4. 1.4.2 Semantic functions of case inflections

Some Australian languages have noun classes which are indicated either by nominal prefixes, as in the languages of Arnhem Land and the Kimberleys, or by free-form determiners as in Dyirbal. Noun classes may relate to gender, animacy and edibility of plants or animals, among other semantic criteria. Kuku Yalanji employs a double set of inflections for ergative, dative, general locative and ablative, which are used, roughly, in accordance with animacy or inanimacy of the referent. H. Hershberger (1 964b:74) assumed that there are in fact two noun classes, "animate" and "inanimate" which determine the choice of the appropriate case inflection. However, further research has shown that the two sets of case inflections do not correspond with two fixed classes of 'animate' and 'inanimate' nouns. It rather appears that it is not an inherent and unchangeable feature of the noun that determines the inflection, but that it is the inflection which adds a semantic aspect (other than a case role) to the noun.

It is not all that unusual for inflections to combine the function of case marker with a non-syntactic function, such as indicating number (Latin) or definiteness (Turkish). However, a system of portmanteau case markers which effect a certain interpretation as to

## 1 24 Chapter 4

the 'animacy' of the inflected noun appears to be quite rare. One other somewhat similar example among Australian languages could be Mangarayi, a Western Roper River language, which uses prefixes that indicate both noun class and case (Merlan 1 982).

To determine the 'extra-grammatical' functions of Kuku Yalanji case inflections and the semantic basis for these functions we first of all have to consider the animacy hierarchy of referents and the distribution of the different types of inflections. A wide range of nouns around the mid-section of the animacy hierarchy will accept case markers from either set which indicates that the rigid terms 'animate' and 'inanimate' may be inappropriate for the two sets of inflections. For the time being I will therefore refer to the two inflection sets as set X and set Y. The animacy hierarchy for Kuku Yalanji nouns and their respective case marking is illustrated in Table 4. 1.

|     | Nominal referent                                                                                                                      | Case marking   |
|-----|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| (1) | humans (including deceased persons and most kinship terms)<br>personified mythical beings<br>ghosts and spirits<br>dogs               | set X          |
| (2) | generic terms with animate reference4<br>vertebrates<br>invertebrates<br>natural forces (sun, wind, electricity, etc.)                | set X or set Y |
| (3) | plants<br>food<br>geographical/geological features<br>body parts, dead bodies<br>language, illness, ceremonies<br>some kinship terms5 | set Y          |

Table 4.1: Animacy hierarchy and case marking

To investigate more fully the use of case inflections in Kuku Yalanji we also have to consider the case marking used for lexical items other than nouns, i.e. pronouns, adjectives, demonstratives, interrogatives, possessive forms, numerals, and location and time words. The case-marking categories for these parts of speech are listed in Table 4.2.

Pronouns, which take regular nominal case inflections for all but the core syntactic cases, generally refer to beings high up on the animacy scale, corresponding with those in category (1) of Table 4. 1. First, second and third person pronouns all behave in the same way.

<sup>4</sup>  For a list of generic terms see §3. 1 .2 (i).

<sup>5</sup>  A full list of these kinship terms can be found in §3.2.4.

| NP constituent                  | Case marking   |
|---------------------------------|----------------|
| pronoun                         | set X          |
| adjective                       | set X or set Y |
| demonstrative                   | set X or set Y |
| interrogative:<br>'who'         | set X          |
| 'what', 'where'                 | set Y          |
| possessive noun or pronoun form | set Y          |
| numeral                         | set Y          |
| location and time words         | set Y          |

Table 4.2: Case marking on noun phrase constituents other than head nouns

Adjectives and demonstratives agree in type of inflection with the head noun of their NP. If they occur by themselves, in an anaphoric situation, their inflectional type still agrees with the understood head noun.

Numerals, although they have a similar function to adjectives in that they provide an additional comment on a noun, do not, as it were, describe an inherent characteristic of the referent. They just add the 'external' aspect of quantity which is variable for any referent. This may be the reason why their type of case marking is not bound to that of a co-occurring noun. A similar aspect of only 'remote link' to the head noun applies for possessive forms, which are also independent in their type of case inflection.

Location and time words, which take nominal case inflections from the set of local cases, clearly stand outside the animacy hierarchy.

Two points emerge from the distribution of type X and type Y case inflections among nouns and other noun phrase constituents:

- (a) For some NP-constituents there is no choice between the types of case inflections. Those that have to take type X inflections have referents high up on the animacy scale (human nouns etc., pronouns, interrogative 'who'). Those that have to take type Y inflections either have referents low down on the animacy scale (plants, tools, etc., interrogative 'what') or may be regarded as standing outside the animacy hierarchy, i.e. possessive forms, numerals and location and time words. (However, why some kinship terms (see §3.2.4) should be included here is quite unclear.)
- (b) If we have a dichotomy of high ranking 'animacy' on one extreme of the scale and 'inanimacy' or 'neutrality' on the other extreme, the choice of inflectional type in the middle section (set (2) in Table 4. 1) must be linked to some aspect of animacy. What is this aspect and how can the two inflection sets be identified accordingly?

Since numerals, possessive forms and location and time words which occupy a neutral position outside the animacy hierarchy invariably take set Y case markers, I call set Y inflections 'neutral'. If these inflections can be regarded as unmarked for semantic content, such content must be looked for in set X inflections.

The feature 'animate' is clearly inaccurate for set X since, as is shown in category (2) of . Table 4. 1, taxonomically 'animate' referents may also take neutral case marking. Consider the difference in case marking for sentences of the following kind. (For brevity I will only give English translations here and indicate the appropriate type of case marking; more examples in Kuku Yalanji will be found in sections §4.1 .4.3 and §4. 1 .4.4.)

,------------\_ .. \_-------

- (i) a. I sat on a mosquito (mosquito + neutral locative) b. I was stung by a mosquito (mosquito + set X ergative)
- (ii) a. I like mudcrab (mudcrab + neutral dative) b. I am afraid of mudcrabs (mudcrab + set X dative)
- (iii) a. A brown snake bit me (brown snake + neutral ergative)
	- b. The brown snake is eating a rat (brown snake + set X ergative)

All a. sentences show the nominal referent in an inactive or involuntarily active state, while all b. sentences mark the referent as a voluntary or potential actor. Neutral case marking in (ii)a. interprets the mudcrab as food while set X inflection in (ii)b. refers to the mudcrab as a potentially threatening actor with its propensity for nipping people's extrerrutles. Neutral case marking in (iii)a. interprets the brown snake bite as an unpremeditated reflex action on provocation while set X inflection in (iii)b implies that the snake is in full possession of its faculties when it feeds on a rat. One could argue that a mudcrab also nips only when trodden on or otherwise disturbed, and that there is therefore inconsistency in the case marking for (ii)b. and (iii)a. However, one important aspect of the use of the two inflection sets in Kuku Yalanji is that, where a choice is possible, a speaker may exercise this choice according to their own interpretation. Thus, while speakers would mostly coincide in their intuitions, one may encounter different perceptions as to the potential for voluntary or involuntary action of a certain referent. For instance 'a brown snake bit me' has also been attested with set X ergative marking. It could be that when talking about a potential threat like the mudcrab in (ii)b., emphasis is laid on the beast's ability for action, while the main characteristic of an accomplished snake bite is seen by most speakers to be an unpremeditated reflex.

Consider also:

- (iv) a. They lie in the sun (sun + neutral Locative)
	- b. The sun dries the ground (sun + set X Ergative)

Many speakers here credit the sun with an internal power with which it can act unprompted and unprovoked as in (iv)b. (There is no indication that the sun is personified in Kuku Yalanji, as it is in some other Australian languages.)

The fact that animate generic terms may take either type of inflection could be seen as underlining the abstract content of such terms, i.e. that they refer to concepts rather than actual referents. The choice of type X inflection with a generic term can be interpreted as indicating a 'real' referent, whereas 'neutral' inflection refers to the abstract concept. Consider:

- (224) a. Dingkar-angka karrkay . kuni-ny. male/man-ERG:pt(A) child.ABS(O) hit-PAST 'That was a man what [sic] hit the child. ' (not a woman; I saw him)
	- b. Dingkar-abu karrkay kuni-ny male/man-ERG(A)

'Some man hit the child.' (I think it was a man; but it could've been another child).

However, neutral inflections with human generic terms are very rare, whereas they become more frequent as one proceeds lower down in the animacy scale.

The semantic clues gleaned from sentences (i) to (iv) fairly well circumscribe the semantic content of set X case inflections. It seems that the most appropriate term for this semantic content is "potent", following Chafe's use of the term in his specification of nouns. "Potent" as defined by Chafe (1 970:1 09) refers to a nominal referent that "has, or is conceived to have, its own internal power" (my emphasis). The notable fact in Kuku Yalanji is that this semantic feature does not have to be inherent in the noun (although it often is, as in the nouns in category (1), Table 4.1 ), but is added to the noun by the case inflection.

To summarise, the two sets of non-zero case inflections in Kuku Yalanji can be termed 'neutral' and 'potent' according to their semantic content. For a large range of nouns there is a choice between 'neutral' and 'potent' case inflections and speakers can exercise this choice according to what they want to express.

To distinguish nouns that always take only one of the two possible inflections from those for which there is a choice I refer to the three categories of Table 4.1 :

| category 1 | ('potent' inflection only)         |
|------------|------------------------------------|
| category 2 | ('potent' or 'neutral' inflection) |
| category 3 | ('neutral' inflection only).       |

### 4. 1.4.3 Core syntactic cases

Core syntactic components of a sentence are those NPs which obligatorily occur with the verb according to its transitivity value.

An intransitive core has the following components:

NP (S) + intransitive vc.

A transitive core consists of:

NP (A) + NP (0) + transitive vc.

(For defintions of S, A and 0 see §4.1 .4. 1 .)

Nominal constituents of an NP in S function take absolutive case marking, which is zero, and pronominal constituents are in nominative case. (For pronoun forms see §3.5.1 ; for NP constituents see §4. 1 . 1 .)

An NP in S function denotes the performer of an action that does not affect an object as expressed by verbs of motion and some verbs of utterance; it may also refer to the experiencer with verbs of rest, bodily functions, emotion or physical state.6 Except for obvious semantic constraints imposed by the verb an NP in S function may be animate or inanimate.

- (225) Yinya kadar that.ABS(S) wallaby.ABS(S) 'That wallaby is running. ' warri-y. run-NONPAST
- (226) Kaba kada-y. rain.ABS(S) come-NONPAST 'Rain is coming. ' (standard conversation opener if there are any clouds in sight)

<sup>6</sup>  In my description of core syntactic functions I employ as far as possible terms used by Grimes ( 1975); I do not, however, use his term 'Agent' which combines some transitive and intransitive subject functions; 'Agent' in Australian case grammar refers exclusively to transitive subject function.

- (232) Ngayu wawula-y. « wawu-wula-y) 1 sg.NOM(S) breath.die-NONP AST 'I am exhausted. '

Nominal constituents of a NP in A function take ergative case marking (see §3.2.2) and pronominal constituents are in nominative case as for S function (see §3.5.1 ).

A NP in A function refers to the performer of an affecting or effecting action on an object, or the experiencer of a sensory perception such as 'see', 'hear', 'smell'. The action may be intentional or accidental, but it must be performed by a referent of a category 1 or category 2 noun, that is someone or something which is thought to be able to act of hislher own accord. (An accidental action by a category 1 noun may be expressed by the adverb kanban 'by mistake' in a normal unmodified transitive sentence, or by a passive construction. See §4.2.4.2 and §4.2.4.3 for details on accidental action.)

Category 2 nouns in A function take 'potent' inflection if credited with responsibility for their action and 'neutral' inflection if not. (Since 'neutral' ergative forms are the same as instrumental forms it is sometimes ambiguous whether a category 2 noun is in ergative or instrumental case. Distinguishing features between ergative and instrumental are discussed in §4. 1 .4.4 (i).)

Examples of category 1 nouns and pronouns in A function:

- (233) Nyulu warru-ngku ngawuya dama-ny. 3sg.NOM(A) yg.man-ERG:pt(A) sea.turtle.ABS(O) spear-PAST 'The young man speared a sea turtle.'
- (234) Bula jalbu-bulal-angka bayan ngara-ny. 3du.NOM(A) woman-pair-ERG:pt(A) camp.ABS(O) set.up-PAST 'The pair of women set up camp. '
- (235) Dubu-ngku nyunguny makunyaji-ny karrkay. ghost-ERG:pt(A) 3sg.ACC(O) meet-PAST child.ABS(O) 'The ghost met the child. '

(236) Dingar-angka kaya kanban kuni-ny. man-ERG:pt(A) dog.ABS(O) by. mistake hit-PAST 'The man hit the dog by mistake.'

Examples of category 2 nouns in A function:

| (237) | Yinya-ngka                   | kubarr-angka  | yalbay-ngka   | maral       | bayka-ny. |  |

|       | 'That big eel bit the girl.' |               |               |             |           |  |

- (241) Nyunguny mili-bu 3sg.ACC(O) jellyfish-ERG(A) 'A jellyfish burnt himlher.' waju-ny. burn-PAST

Nominal constituents of a NP in 0 function stand in absolutive case, as for S function, and pronominal constituents are marked for accusative. Examples of nouns in 0 function can be found in sentences (233), (234), (236), (237); examples of pronouns in 0 function are in (240), (241 ).

A NP in 0 function denotes a patient which is affected by an action (examples in (233), (236), (237), (238), (239), (240) and (24 1)), or factitive which is the object that is effected by an action (example in (234)), or an experiencer (as in sentence (235)).

### 4. 1.4.4 Peripheral syntactic and local cases

Core sentences in Kuku Yalanji may be extended by one or more NPs in a peripheral syntactic or local case. These are: instrumental, dative, general locative, ablative, abessive and perlative.7 (For inflectional forms see §3.2.2.) In my identification of the semantic roles of these cases I follow Blake (1 977).

### (i) Instrumental

The instrumental case indicates the implement, which may be a body part, with which an action is performed. There is no 'potent' case inflection for instrumental, which shows that the implement employed in an action is in no way thought of as having any 'own internal power'. Examples:

<sup>7</sup> See R. Hershberger (1 979) for NP constituents in instrumental case (pp.50-5 1), associative (dative) (pp.5 1-52) and locative including perlative, which she analysed as "instrument case marker + \_rr <sup>n</sup> (pp.52-54).

# 1 30 Chapter 4

- (242) Dingar-angka yawu dama-ny yinba-bu. man-ERG:pt(A) stingray.ABS(O) spear-PAST 3-prong spear-INST 'The man speared the stingray with a three-pronged spear. '
- (243) N gayu mayi yala-ku dingka-l mara-bu. I sg.NOM(A) fruit.ABS(O) thiS-ADV squeeze-NONPAST hand-INST 'I squeeze the fruit like this with my hand.'

If the instrument should be an otherwise animate noun, which has never been encountered spontaneously but only after a lot of prompting, it appears that the 'instrument' is perceived to be the inanimate body of the referent,8 for example:

(244) Warru-ngku kaya jarba-bu kanga-ny. yg.man-ERG:pt(A) dog.ABS(O) snake-INST chase-PAST 'The young man chased the dog with a snake.' (i.e. throwing a dead snake at it)

Concepts like 'I hunt pigs with a dog' where the 'instrument' is an active participant accompanying the agent are expressed by comitative (see §4.6. 1 ).

Instrumental case inflections coincide in form with the 'neutral' ergative inflection, but there are syntactic reasons for distinguishing the two cases:

(a) A noun in instrumental case may occur in an intransitive sentence whereas this is impossible for a noun in ergative case, for example:

- (245) Jana jalbu jina-bu dunga-y. 3pl.NOM(S) woman.ABS(S) foot-INST go-NONPAST 'The women are walking on foot. ' (lit. going with feet)
- (246) Maral bungku-bu janjana-y. girl.ABS(S) knee-INST stand.REDUP-NONPAST 'The girl is kneeling. ' (lit. standing with knees)

(b) An instrumental NP remains unchanged in a reflexive construction (see §4.2.4.2) whereas an ergative NP changes to absolutive case (see Blake 1 977:45).

- (247) a. Ngayku-wun-du ngamu-ngku minya yaka-l naybu-bu. I sg.POSS-ERG(A) mother-ERG:ptCA) meat.ABS(O) cut-NONPAST knife-lNSI 'My mother is cutting meat with a knife.'
	- b. N gayku ngamu yaka-ji-ny 1 sg.POSS.ABS(S) mother .ABS(S) cut -REF-PAST 'My mother cut herself with a knife.' naybu-bu. knife-INST

(c) An instrumental NP remains unchanged in a passive construction, which involves the syntactic change A> LOC and 0> S (see §4.2.4.3). Passivisation of sentences containing an NP with instrumental/'neutral' ergative inflection shows that firstly, a category 3 noun is always understood to be in instrumental case even where there is no explicit agent, and secondly, it may be ambiguous whether a category 2 noun is in instrumental or ergative case. Consider the following:

(248) a. Nganya juku-bu kuni-ny. I sg.ACC(O) tree-INST hit-PAST 'A tree hit me.'

<sup>8</sup>  See Fillmore as referred to in Blake (1 977:47).
