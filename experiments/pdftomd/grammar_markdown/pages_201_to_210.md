# 4.4.5 Relative clauses

The definition of a relative clause depends on a formal or grammatical and a functional or semantic aspect. The formal aspect is that a relative clause is a constituent of a NP which may be indicated by case agreement,<sup>38</sup> and possible contiguity to the head noun. The functional aspect is that the relative clause supplies information about the head of this NP, thus helping to identify it. Both formal and functional criteria are important but, to my mind, the functional aspect is the more significant one. Thus a subordinate clause which is formally part of a NP, but is not relevant for the identification of this NP, cannot be termed a relative clause. Consider Comrie's (1981: 1 36) statement on the definition of a relative clause following a comparison between English and Turkish:

The lesson of this comparison is thus tha� we need a functional (semantic, cognitive) definition of relative clause, on the basis of which we can then proceed to compare relative clauses across languages, neglecting language-specific syntactic differences in our over-all definition of relative clause, but using them as a basis for our typology ...

There is no specific subordinating procedure in Kuku Yalanji which serves the sole purpose of relativising a NP according to the above definition. However, simultaneous subordinate constructions with different actor, as was briefly indicated in §4.4.4.1, may, with some caution, be interpreted as relative clauses. Consider (457H46 1) above and the following examples:

- (504) larramali-ngka bulki dalbarri-ny, manjal-ba thunderstorm-ERG:pt(A) cow.ABS(O) strike-PAST mountain-LOC (505) janjana-nya. stand.REDUP-SUB 'A thunderstorm struck the cow [which was/while it was] standing on the mountain.' Buliman-angka warru karrba-ny, police-ERG:pt(A) yg.man.ABS(O) grab-PAST house.ABS(O) janjarri-I-janjarri-nya. snoop-I-REDUP-SUB bayan 'The policeman apprehended the chap [who was/while he was] snooping
	- in the house.'

Such sentences are apparently open to two interpretations, termed "NP-relative" and ''Trelative" by K. Hale ( 1 976a). A NP-relative clause provides information about an argument in the main clause where main and subordinate clause share an identical argument, e.g. 'the cow which .. .' 'the chap who . . . '. A T-relative clause specifies the temporal setting of the

<sup>38</sup> This applies for instance in Latin and Greek; see Comrie (1981:1 46).

event in the main clause where two clauses make identical time reference, e.g. 'while (the cow) was standing', 'while (the chap) was snooping'.

On the evidence of these types of sentence it is impossible to decide whether the subordinate clause is embedded under the NP or adjoined under a lower S-node in deep structure. If it is true that both the NP-relative and the T-relative interpretation are possible, we can but speculate that their underlying structure is formally different, in which case there must be a transformation somewhere along the line which produces the same surface structure for both clause types.39 Alternatively, we can assume that their underlying formal structure is identical,<sup>40</sup> in which case a semantic rule would have to be responsible for giving the surface structure two different meanings. Thus positing a deep structure for these sentences is unsatisfactory either way. However, simultaneous subordinate structures with a perception verb in the main clause in Kuku Yalanji seem to suggest a structual difference between the NP-relative and the T-relative interpretation. Consider (462}-(465) and:

(506) a. Nyulu dingkar nyaji-l-nyaji-ny, bana 3sg.NOM(A) man.ABS(O) see-l-REDUP-PAST water.ABS(O) wulji-l-wulji-nya buwun-muny. bail.out-l-REDUP-SUB boat-ABL 'He watched the man [who was] bailing water from the boat. ' b. Nyulu nyaji-l-nyaji-ny, dingkar-angka bana 3sg.NOM(A) see-l-REDUP-PAST man-ERG:pt(A) water.ABS(O)

wulji-l-wulji-inya buwun-muny. bail.out-l-REDUP-SUB man-ERG:pt(A) 'He watched [whilelhow] the man was bailing water from the boat.'

In sentence (506b) it is fairly clear that the subordinate clause is derived from an adjoined clause: dingkarangka bana wuljilwuljiny buwunmuny 'the man was bailing water from the boat'. By comparison it would appear plausible to assume that in sentence (506a) we have a NP-relative clause dominated by the transitive object NP dingkar. But neither in sentences of type (504) and (505) nor in sentences of type (506) can we get away from the fact that the temporal interpretation is the overriding one: main and subordinate clause must refer to simultaneous events. A subordinate clause with -nyV cannot be used to express for instance 'the policeman apprehended the chap who had been snooping in the house yesterday' or 'a little while ago I saw the man who is now bailing out his boat'. Thus the characteristic identifying function of a relative clause is at best marginal in simultaneous verb + -nyV constructions, if it is present at all. To determine this, one would require the intuition of a native speaker, and it is quite possible that my own intuitions based on English and German would lead me to interpret, i.e. translate, a relative clause where this does not exist or is irrelevant for a native speaker of Kuku Yalanji.

Consider also verb + -nyV constructions with same actor, as for instance in (468)-(473) and:

| (507) | <i>Maral-angka dikal</i>                          | <i>nyaji-l-nyaji-l,</i>      | <i>janjana-nya-mun-du.</i> |
|-------|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------|
|       | girl-ERG:pt(A) bird.ABS(O)                        | see- <i>l</i> -REDUP-NONPAST | stand.REDUP-SUB-mun-ERG    |
|       | 'The girl watches the bird [while] standing up.'  |                              |                            |
|       | * 'The girl who is standing up watches the bird.' |                              |                            |

<sup>39</sup> K. Hale (1976a:85) refers to this as the "extraction analysis".

<sup>40</sup> K. Hale (1 976a:85) refers to this as the "adjunction analysis".

The subordinate clause janjananyamundu (with deleted S), although part of the A NP as indicated by the case agreement, does not, according to native speakers, identify the girl but rather refers to the manner in which she performs the action of watching. On the other hand, some examples with co-referential actor again invite a T-relative interpretation in that the temporal co-occurrence of two actions is emphasised as in (469), (472) and (473). To summarise, the status of the most likely candidates for subordinate relative clauses in Kuku Yalanji, i.e. simultaneous subordinate constructions, is at least doubtfu1.41

To my knowledge, only independent clauses can unambiguously fulfil the function of further identifying the referent of an NP in Kuku Yalanji, as in:

- (508) Nyulu jalbu-ngku dunyu bawa-ny. 3sg.NOM(A) woman-ERG:pt(A) husband.ABS(O) leave-PAST Nyulu yinyay bundanda-y kangkal-ji. 3sg.NOM(S) there sit-REDUP-NONPAST own.child-cOMIT 'The woman left her husband. She [who] is sitting there with her child.'

# 4. 4.6 Summary

Table 4.3 summarises the forms, functions and common NP deletion possibilities of subordinate clauses in Kuku Yalanji. As can be seen from this table there is a preponderance of obligatory co-referential S/A or co-referential 0 deletion. This indicates that in subordinate structures Kuku Yalanji apparently leans towards a S/A pivot which disinguishes between the grammatical function of S/A as subject on the one hand and 0 as transitive object on the other hand. Thus, in spite of its ergative/absolutive case-marking system, Kuku Yalanji displays to some degree characteristics of a nominative/accusative language in subordinate constructions.

Complex sentences with more than one subordinate clause are not commonly used in Kuku Yalanji, although they are possible. Of all subordinate clauses the purposive clause is most likely to be followed by another clause that has some logical connection, for example:

41 Similar, although in some respects slightly different, problems in determining relative clauses exist in Yidiny (Dixon 1 977 :423-428).

#### 4.5 Possession

Like most Australian languages Kuku Yalanji has the means to distinguish syntactically between alienable and inalienable possession. Alienable possession includes concrete and abstract things, e.g. artefacts, animals, language, and kinship relations. The possessor is usually animate and normally human. However, the construction used for alienable possession may also be used for inalienable possession, i.e. part-whole relationship, and where the possessor is inanimate; it will therefore be termed 'general (alienable) possession'. On the other hand, different constructions are available to express part-whole relationship or inanimate possessor, which cannot be used for alienable possession by an animate possessor.

#### 4.5. 1 General (alienable) possession

General (alienable) possession is marked by the stem-forming suffixes:

-(V)mu (Yalanji), -(V)ngV (Nyungkul) / -zero inflection

-(V)ndVmun- / -non-zero inflection (see §3.2.3.2)

on all words of the possessive NP, which modifies the head noun. Thus an alienable possessive NP has the structure:

[[NP] + case [NP + POSs] + case] NP

A possessive stem always takes neutral inflection. The head noun and the POSS NP may occur in any order. Some examples of a possessive NP in absolutive case, showing both the Yalanji and Nyungkul suffixes, are:

- (5 1 2) Nganjan -amu kaya jinbal-ku wanarri-y. -anga father-POSS.ABS(S) dog.ABS(S) fast-ADV run.REDUP-NONPAST 'Father's dog is running fast. '
- (5 1 3) Kuyu-mu jindi jabajaba. -ngu fish-POSS.ABS(S) scale.ABS(S) big/plentiful 'The scales of the fish are big and plentiful.'
- (5 1 4) Kuyu ngulkurr wawubaja-mu. -nga fish.ABS(S) good river-POSSABS(S) 'The fish of in (lit. of) the river are good.'

# 1 86 Chapter 4

Example (5 1 3) expresses inalienable possession and in (5 1 4) the 'possessor' is inanimate. (Note that in the Nyungkul dialect the possessive suffix cannot be distinguished from neutral locative inflection if the noun ends in a vowel.)

Some examples of possessive NPs in other than absolutive cases are:

- (515) Dingkar-andamun-du yaba-ngka bikibiki kuni-ny. man-POSS-ERG(A) eB-ERG:pt(A) pig.ABS(O) kill-PAST 'The man's elder brother killed a pig. '
- (5 1 6) N gayu binal-ma-l bama-ndamun-ku 1sg.NOM(S) know-INCHO-NONPAST Aborigine-POSS-DAT food-DAT 'I am learning about Aborigines' food.' mayi-ka.
- (5 1 7) Nganjin yambayamba Toyota-nga mumba-ny 3pl.exc.NOM(A) everything.ABS(O) Toyota-LOC put.in-PAST

Chris-andamun-bu. Chris-POSS-LOC 'We put everything into Chris's Toyota.'

Example (5 1 5) illustrates kinship relation expressed by alienable possession.

Very seldom does a possessive NP contain a 'possessor of a possessor'. Such constructions contain a regular possessive form without a second possessive suffix and optional case inflection, for example:

(5 1 8) Ngayu wawu-kari yunu-wun-ku nganjan-andamun-ku kaya-nka. I sg.NOM(S) like-PRIV 2sg-POSS-DAT father-POSS-DAT dog-DAT:pt 'I don't like your father's dog. '

However, there seems to be a strong tendency to use the POSS + LOC form for 'possessor of' possessor', no matter what case the head noun is in. In (5 1 8) yunu-wun-bu (LOC) is just as acceptable, and indeed preferred over the dative form.

# 4.5.2 Inalienable possession

Inalienable possession may be expressed by a general possession NP as in (5 1 3), and:

(5 1 9) Nyungu mungka duna. 3sg.POSS.ABS(S) hair.ABS(S) wet 'His hair is wet.'

But it is more common to place whole and part in apposition within the NP, both agreeing in case, but without a possessive suffix at all. Such an NP has the form:

[whole + case part + case]NP

Examples of this can be seen for instance in (483) and (486) and also:

| (520) | Nyulu                               | kuyu        | biji        | kayi-ny.  |  |
|-------|-------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-----------|--|
|       | 3sg.NOM(A)                          | fish.ABS(O) | tail.ABS(O) | hook-PAST |  |
|       | 'He hooked the fish (on) the tail.' |             |             |           |  |

(52 1) Nyulu kulji dara-y-mani-ny maral-anda jina-nga. 3sg.NOM(A) stone.ABS(O) fall-y-CAUS-PAST girl-LOC:pt foot-LOC 'He dropped the stone on the girl's foot.'

As shown previously in (5 1 5) kinship relations are expressed by general alienable possession. However, when talking about someone's offspring, e.g. own child or grandchild, this may also be indicated by inalienable possession:

- (522) Ngayu kangkal jambul. I sg.NOM(S) own.child.ABS(S) two 'I have two children.'
- (523) Ngayu kaminjarr jalbu-jalbu wubul. I sg.NOM(S) gr.child.ABS(S) woman-REDUP.NOM(S) many 'I have many granddaughters.' (Kaminjarr refers to female ego's daughter's child and male ego's son's child.)

The speaker in both instances was a female, so by a little stretch of imagination one could interpret these constructions as whole-part relationship. (I do not know whether a male could say the same thing.)

# 4.5.3 Inanimate possessor

Again, an inanimate possessor may have the general possessive form as in (5 1 4), but this is somewhat unusual. More common is the use of locative or ablative, indicating the location or origin of something. For instance:

| (524) | Birra                                                  | juku-ngu/juku-muny | yalbay-bajaku. |
|-------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------|
|       | leaves.ABS(S)                                          | tree-LOC/tree-ABL  | big-very       |
|       | 'The leaves on this tree/from this tree are very big.' |                    |                |

The locative refers to the leaves that are actually on the tree, whereas the ablative implies that the leaves have been plucked or fallen off. Similarly:

(525) Mayi yinya-nga/-muny juku-ngu/-muny ngulkurr nuka-ji-y fruit.ABS(S) that-LOO-ABL tree-LOOABL good eat-ITR-NONPAST 'Fruit onlfrom that tree is good to eat.'

On the other hand, ablative was not accepted in the following sentence:

| (526) | Dumbul       | marra-nga/-mu/*-muny                                                               | dandi. |
|-------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
|       | shell.ABS(S) | zamia.nut-LOC/-POSS.ABS(S)/*-ABL<br>'The shell on/of/*from the zamia nut is hard.' | hard   |

(Maybe once the shells are peeled off, they are all crumbled up and softened.) Note that the above examples are in Yalanji dialect, which clearly distinguishes in form between locative and possessive. Therefore juku-ngu and marra-nga are definitely in locative case.

# 4.5.4 Former possession

To indicate a former possession, the particle (or suffix?) mali is employed following a noun or pronoun in locative or ablative case. The choice of case differs between speakers, some preferring locative, others ablative, for example:

(527) Yinya ngayku-ndu/-ndumuny(-)mali dunyu. that 1sg-LOC/-ABL(-)former.possession husband 'That is my former husband.'

# 1 88 Chapter 4

(528) Yinya bayan jalbu-ndul-ndumuny(-)mali. that house woman-Loci-ABL(-)former.possession 'That house formerly belonged to a woman.'

At this stage it is not clear whether mali is a particle or a suffix or a clitic.43

# 4.5.5 Relationship between possessive and locative

In some Australian languages, for instance Guugu Yimidhirr (Haviland 1 979a) and Gumbaynggir (Eades 1 979), there is a close relationship between possessive (or genitive) and dative which marks the recipient of an act of giving. A similar close relationship pertains in Kuku Yalanji between possessive and locative.

In Kuku Yalanji the recipient of an act of giving may be in locative case as was shown in the discussion of case roles (§4.1 .4.4 (iii» , as for instance:

(529) Bula jalbu-bulal-angka mayi kubarr 3du.NOM(A) woman-pair-ERG:pt(A) food.ABS(O) eel.ABS(O) daji-ny dingkar-anda. give-PAsT man-LOC:pt 'The two women gave the eel to the man.'

But the recipient may also be a possessive NP in 0 function:

| (530) | Ngayu                                                   | ngamu-mu           | mayi        | daji-ny.  |  |
|-------|---------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|-------------|-----------|--|
|       | 1sg.NOM(A)                                              | mother-POSS.ABS(O) | food.ABS(O) | give-PAST |  |
|       | 'I gave mother [her] food.' (lit. I gave mother's food) |                    |             |           |  |

It may be arguable whether the whole possessive NP in constructions of the above type is in 0 function or only the 'possessed' part. If the possessive noun, i.e. ngamu-mu, were not in o function, possessive in connection with daja-l 'give' would have to be interpreted as an inflection indicating 'goal' rather than a derivation. However, possessive apparently cannot be used if the thing that is given is omitted, e.g. 'I gave (it) to mother'. In such instances only locative is possible. Furthermore, possessive cannot be substituted for locative to indicate 'goal' in other three argument verbs such as milbi-l 'show'. I therefore prefer the interpretation of possessive as a derivation only and the whole possessive NP being in 0 function in connection with 'give'.

There may be a slight difference in the interpretation of the above sentences in that a possessive NP in 0 function implies that the recipient has a rightful entitlement to the thing given, whereas a locative form indicates spontaneous giving without obligation. However, this is mainly conjecture on my part based on the Aboriginal tradition of obligatory sharing among kin and on somewhat similar constructions in English and other languages such as 'I gave the boy his breakfast' versus 'I gave the clothes to the Smith Family'. But the fact remains that the recipient of goods may be either a possessive or a locative NP.

The fact that an inanimate possessor may involve locative (or ablative) is probably of no great value for this argument, since usually there is a real location involved, such as 'leaves on the tree'. However, it is noteworthy that possessive may be used as well to express this concept; and note the use of a noun or pronoun in locative (or ablative) case in conjunction

<sup>43</sup> Compare "general genitive inflection" -mi in DyirbaJ which indicates a "past owner" in contrast to "simple genitive" -nu which expresses "present possession" (Dixon 1 972: 1 08).

with (-)mali to express former possession. Consider also the morphology of the possessive stem-forming suffix -(V)ndVmun-, which is used if a non-zero inflection follows. This suffix looks remarkably like potent locative inflection plus catalytic suffix: -(V)ndV- + -mun- . But this similarity does not warrant the general reinterpretation of locative as a derivation, since this form occurs only in possessive function.

More circumstantial evidence for some relationship between locative and possessive can be gleaned from the fact that a 'possessor of a possessor' is preferred to have the form 'possessive pronoun stem + LOC' regardless of the case marking of the NP to which it belongs. Finally, there is the matter of the set of kinship terms which allow either potent or neutral case inflection. In a possessive NP these may take either the regular possessive suffix or a suffix which is identical to the neutral locative inflection (see §3.2.4).

For the time being, the conspicuous resemblance between possessive and locative in Kuku Yalanji provides food for thought, rather than giving any conclusive evidence as to the exact nature of the relationship between the two.44

#### 4.6 Comitative and privative

Comitative and privative forms of nouns are opposite in meaning, which is basically 'with Noun' and 'without Noun' respectively, but they both serve as modifiers and as such may be incorporated into a wider NP which has the structure:

$$\begin{array}{rcl} \text{[[NP1] + case]} & \text{[NP2 + COMIT] + case} \text{[NP]}\\ & \text{[}\_{\text{ass}}\text{]} \text{[}\_{\text{ann}}\text{]} & \text{[}\_{\text{PRIV}}\text{]} \end{array}$$

NP1 may be a personal or demonstrative pronoun or a single noun or both for either construction. NP2 may have the same constituents as NP1 or a noun plus an adjective, both with comitative suffix, in a comitative noun phrase. A privative construction, on the other hand, can have only a single noun or adjective in NP2. Like an adjective, a comitative or privative form on its own may function as predicator in an equational sentence.

#### 4. 6. 1 Comitative

A noun with comitative suffix -(i)ji (,neutral'), -(V)nji ('potent'), -(i)jirr- (see §3.2.3.3) may have various functions in a clause. Following the list set out in Dixon, ed. (1 976:306- 307), with some amendments that apply for Kuku Yalanji, these are:

#### (i) Attribute

In this function the comitative noun resembles an adjective and may be used as predicator in an equational sentence or as a modifier within a wider NP, which will be discussed later. Note that although translations of some of the sentences below necessarily include 'have' the comitative does not indicate a relationship of possession, but rather a characteristic. The attributive functions of comitative can be classed under the following headings:

<sup>44</sup> Note that in some languages, e.g. Russian, the way to say 'I have X' is 'X is at me' using locative case or an equivalent preposition. See Clark (1 978) and Lyons (1977:722-723) for a general discussion on the relation between location and possession.
