(541) Nyungu ngaji wungar-iji wula-ny. 3sg.POSS.ABS(S) MF.ABS(S) sun-COMIT die-PAST 'His grandfather died in the hot season.'

Some examples of NPs containing comitative attributes in various cases are:

- (542) Warru-ngku jarba kuli-ji kuni-ny. yg.man-ERG:pt(A) snake.ABS(O) rage-COMIT.ABS(O) kill-PAST 'The young man killed the vicious snake. '

	- (548) Warru-warru bikibiki-nga dunga-y kaya-nji. yg.man-REDUP.ABS(S) pig-LOC go-NONPAST dog-coMIT:pt 'The young men are going out for pigs with a dog/dogs.'

- (b) A person in motion with helpful or non-helpful inanimate implement:
	- (550) Nyulu dingki-ji badabada dunga-ny wawubaja-nga. 3sg.NOM(S) dinghy-COMIT down go-PAST river-LOC 'He went down the river with a dinghy. '

## 1 92 Chapter 4

(55 1) Wulman dunga-y kalka-ji waymbil-ji. old.man.ABS(S) go-NONPAST spear-COMIT axe-COMIT 'The old man is going out with a spear and an axe.'

If, on the other hand, a body part is involved in the motion, this must be in instrumental case; see (245) and (246) in §4. 1 .4.4 (i).

#### (c) A person at rest with inanimate thing:

(552) Jawun bundanda-y friend.ABS(S) sit.REDUP-NONP AST wulngku-ji. tape.recorder-COMIT kaban-kaban-ji paper/book-REDUP-COMIT '[Our] friend is sitting with papers/books and a tape-recorder.' (wulngku originally: 'song, tune')

(d) An animate being performing an action (other than movement) with an implement or together with another animate being. In Kuku Yalanji this use of comitative is apparently restricted to intransitive sentences and therefore differs from the instrumental use of comitative with transitive verbs attested for other languages (see Dixon, ed. 1 976:306).

| (553) | Yinya | kaya                               | kinka-n-kinka-y                                        | bajibay-ji. |
|-------|-------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------|

(554) Warru wuri-n-wuri-y jinkurr-ji. yg.man.ABS(S) dance-n-REDUP-NONPAST yZ-COMIT 'The young man is dancing with his younger sister. '

It will have been noticed that the examples of comitative in 'accompaniment' function do not indicate absolutive case agreement with the head noun. In fact, because an 'accompaniment' interpretation of comitative is possible only in intransitive sentences it cannot be ascertained whether the comitative form is part of the S NP since absolutive has zero realisation. In the absence of definite evidence for case agreement one could argue that comitative in 'accompaniment' sense has a more inflectional characteristic, whereas it is clearly a derivation in attributive function. Note also that an 'accompaniment' comitative form is preferred in clause-final position, whereas an attributive comitative form is normally found adjacent to the head noun. However, this aspect is obviously not sufficient support for an interpretation of 'accompaniment' comitative as inflection. I therefore regard comitative as having only one grammatical function, i.e. that of derivational suffix.

## 4. 6.2 Privative

Privative forms (see §3 .2.3.4) are used less frequently than comitative forms in Kuku Yalanji. Their attributive functions as outlined below correspond largely to those of comitative, but privative forms are preferred as predicator in equational sentences and less favoured as part of a wider NP.

(i) Privative forms in adjectival or attributive function:

(a) Mental or corporeal state (cf. comitative (i)(a))

- (555) Jana kiru-kari. 3pl.NOM(S) brain-PRIV 'They are stupid.'
- (556) Ngayu ngiki-kari, ngulkurr-ma-ny. I sg.NOM(S) coughlcold-PRIV good-INCHO-PAST 'J don't have a cold, [I am] well again.'
- (b) Physical characteristic (cf. comitative (i)(b))
	- (557) Nyulu wulbuman dirra-kari. 3sg.NOM(S) old.woman.ABS(S) tooth-PRIV 'The old woman has no teeth.'
	- (558) Nyulu mungka-kari-ngka ngayku dambal 3sg.NOM(A) hair-PRIV-ERG:pt(A) I sg.POSS.ABS(O) shoes.ABS(O) ngaki-ny. steal-PAST 'The one without hair stole my shoes.'
- (c) 'Non-possession' (cf. comitative (i)(d))
	- (559) Nyulu bayan-kari jibabadi-y. 3sg.NOM(S) house-PRIV.ABS(S) be.sad-NONPAST 'The homeless one is sad. '
	- (560) Nganjin tealeaf-kari. I sg.exc.NOM(S) tea-PRIV 'We have no tea.'
	- (56 1) Ngayu kambi daji-ny jalbu-ndu kangkal-kari-nda I sg.NOM(A) clothes.ABS(O) give-PAST woman-LOc:pt own.child-PRIV-LOC 'J gave clothes to the childless woman.'

'Non-accompaniment' use (cf. comitative (ii)) of a privative form is rare. Some examples are:

- (562) Nyulu dunga-ny marrkin-kari. 3sg.NOM(S) gO-PAST rifle-PRIV 'He went without a rifle.'
- (563) Ngawa warngku-wuna-y kararr-kari. baby.ABS(S) sleep-lie-PAST blanket-PRIV 'The baby sleeps without a blanket.'

For motion or rest without animate accompaniment (cf. comitative (ii)(a)) the privative form is not favoured at all but a paraphrase like the following is preferred:

(564) Ngayu kari jilba-dunga-y jalbu-nji, I sg.NOM(S) NEG walk-go-NONPAST woman-COMIT ngayu-rrku dunga-y. I sg.NOM(S)-EMPH4 go-NONPAST 'J don't go walkabout with the women, J go by myself. '

# 1 94 Chapter 4

### 4.7 Imperatives

An imperative can be formed from any verbal root or stem in Kuku Yalanji (see §3.8.4.2 (iii)). Normally, it has an explicit or implicit second person pronoun in S or A function. If mentioned, the subject is strongly preferred in initial position, but it may also occur elsewhere in the sentence:

- (565) (Yurra) julurri-ji-ka! 2pl.NOM(S) wash-REF-IMP 'Wash yourselves !'
- (566) (Yundu) ngamu 2sg.NOM(A) mother.ABS(O) 'Don't blame [your] mother !' kari nyuya! NEG blame.lMP
- (567) (Yundu) yinya dara-y-mana! 2sg.NOM(A) that.ABS(O) fall-y-CAUS.lMP 'Drop that!'

If the subject NP is included, the imperative can be distinguished from a statement by the intonation contour (see §2.6.3).

A reduplicated verb stem would prompt the addressee to continue with some activity, as typically in:

(568) (Yubal) bundanda-ka, ngayu kada-y-baja! 2du.NOM(S) sit.REDUP-IMP I sg.NOM(S) come-NONPAST-again '(Y ou two) keep sitting there, I will come back.'

Occasionally, a first person inclusive non-singular pronoun may be the subject of an imperative clause. This expresses an encouragement to do something, as for instance:

(569) (N gana) kada-ri-ka-da! I pI. inc.NOM(S) come-PLS-IMP-TEMPI "Come on, let's go now!"

An imperative sentence may contain the particle balu 'desist' (see §4.9.2 (ii)) , which implies that the addressee should leave someone or something alone. This has only been attested with intransitive imperative sentences:

| (570) | Balu dungay!   | 'Let him/her go!' |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|
| (571) | Balu wajujika! | 'Let it burn!'    |

But there is no apparent reason why balu should not be used with a transitive imperative sentence as well, for example:

(572) ? Balu nyulu mayi nuka! 'Let him eat his food!'

The temporal verbal clitic -da, which means 'following with respect to a preceding action' (see §3.10.1 ), is very often used with imperatives. While a plain imperative form such as mayi nuka 'eat food!' may be regarded as a general prompt of the type 'eat something! (you must be hungry)' or 'go on, eat your food, don't mind me!', the form mayi nuka-da urges the addressee to eat now and to discontinue any other activity. A stronger command for immediate action can be expressed by the clitic -(ng)Vrr 'straight away/first of all' (see §3.1 0.1), for example:

# (573) Nuka-ngarr! OR Mayi-ngarr nuka! 'Eat straight away (before you do anything else)!'

The urgency in -(ng)Vrr which forbids any other possible activity by the addressee was illustrated in the following way. My informant Louisa Smith wanted her daughter to come and help with her sick father. She called: "Nora kaday, hand daya!" (sic) "Nora come here and give me a hand!" When this brought no response she called again: "Nora kadayarr! " When still no Nora arrived, Louisa exclaimed forcefully: "Nora, come here first!" (which is in fact a very common strong English imperative used by the Kuku Yalanji people).

Apparently there is no politeness distinction between imperatives with different clitics. As a very well-mannered person assured me, she could use all imperative forms when speaking to her children as well as when speaking to the pastor. R. Hershberger (l 964b:52) distinguishes between -ngarr as polite imperative marker and -rr as emphatic imperative marker. According to my data these are allomorphs of the same form (see §3. 10.1) and, as indicated above, do not imply politeness/emphatic distinction.

### 4.8 Questions

Polar questions, requiring a yes/no answer, are marked only by intonation contour (see §2.6.3) and para-linguistic features, such as facial expression, in Kuku Yalanji.

| (574) | Yundu      | ngayku                    | kangkal          | nyaji-ny? |
|-------|------------|---------------------------|------------------|-----------|
|       | 2sg.NOM(A) | 1sg.POSS.ABS(O)           | own.child.ABS(O) | see-PAST  |
|       |            | 'Have you seen my child?' |                  |           |

(575) Nyulu kada-ny-baja? 3sg.NOM(S) come-PAsT-again 'Did he come back?'

For non-polar questions there is a range of interrogative pronouns, which were discussed in §3.6.1, including some examples. Further examples of the use of interrogative pronouns are:

- (576) Wanya kada-ny maja-nji? who.ABS(S) come-PAST bOSS-COMIT:pt 'Who came with the boss?'
- (577) Wanya-ngka ngayku dambal wundi-ny? who-ERG:pt(A) I sg.POSS.ABS(O) shoes.ABS(O) take-PAST 'Who took my shoes?'
- (578) Yundu wanya-nji Cooktown dunga-ny? 2sg.NOM(S) who-COMIT:pt Cooktown gO-PAST 'With whom did you go to Cooktown?'
- (579) Yundu wanyu mumba-ny balji-nga? 2sg.NOM(A) what.ABS(O) put.in-PAST bag-LOC 'What did you put in the bag?'
- (580) Wanyurri-ngku mayi-ka yundu wawu? what-DAT food-DAT 2sg.NOM(S) want/like 'What (sort of) food do you wantllike?
- (58 1) Nyulu wanja-muny? 3sg.NOM(S) where-ABL 'Where is he from?'
- (582) Wanjawanja yundu kada-y-baja, wungariji? when 2sg.NOM(S) come-NONPAST-again hot.season 'When will you come back, (in the) hot season?
- (583) Wanjarrinya bama yinyay how.many Aborigine.ABS(S) there 'How many Aborigines live there?' bundanda-y? sit.REDUP-NONP AST

#### 4.9 Particles

In this section we will look at particles with a function at clause or sentence level, i.e. adjectival, comparison, negation and discourse particles. (For morphological features of these particles see §3.9.)

### 4.9. 1 Adjectival particles

Non-inflecting adjectival particles (see §3.9.1) function as predicators, taking as complement either a noun in dative case or a purposive clause. The following sentences exemplify the use of all attested adjectival particles:

- (584) Jana nyiku binal-kari kuku-ku. 3pl.NOM(S) today know-PRIV language-DAT 'They don't know the language nowadays.'
- (585) Jalbu binal balji wukurri-nka. woman.ABS(S) know dillybag.ABS(O) weave-PURP 'The woman knows how to weave dillybags.'
- (586) Nyulu dingkar juburr bulki-ka. 3sg.NOM(S) man.ABS(S) be.good.at cattle-DAT 'The man is good at/with cattle. '
- (587) Ngayu yinil bilngkumu-nku. I sg.NOM(S) afraid crocodile-DAT 'I'm afraid of crocodiles.'
- (588) Karrkay-karrkay wawu jirray kinka-n-kinka-nka. child-REDUP.ABS(S) like much play-n-REDUP-PURP 'The children love to play. '
- (589) Nyulu wawu kalka balka-nka. 3sg.NOM(S) want spear.ABS(O) make-PURP 'He wants to make a spear.'
- (590) Karrkay wawu ngaki-ji-nka. child.ABS(S) wantllike hide-REF-PURP 'The child wantsllikes to hide. '

As can be seen in (585) and (589) the subject NP does not change to y function if the following purposive clause contains a transitive verb. This shows that the clause with adjectival particle must be regarded as an intransitive main clause and the adjoined purposive clause as subordinate. In Guugu Yimidhirr (Ra viland 1 979a: 1 54) a distinction between main and subordinate clause with similar adjectival particles is not clear cut, since the subject NP may be in A function if the purposive complement clause contains a transitive verb.

In derived inchoative verb form, adjectival particles maintain the same syntactic type of complement, for example:

# (59 1) Ngayu binalmal kukuku. 'I learn language. '

In derived causative verb form, however, they naturally are accompanied by a noun in 0 function, with an optional goal as dative noun or purposive clause, for example:

| (592) | <i>Kambakamba-ngka</i>                                                  | <i>nganya</i>    | <i>binal-bunga-ny</i> | <i>mayi-ka</i> |
|-------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|-----------------------|----------------|
|       | old.women-ERG:pt(A)                                                     | 1sg.ACC(O)       | know-CAUS-PAST        | food-DAT       |
|       | <i>jarruka</i>                                                          | <i>baka-nka.</i> |                       |                |
|       | scrub.hen.ABS(O)                                                        | dig-PURP         |                       |                |
|       | 'The old women taught me about food (and) how to dig scrub hen (eggs).' |                  |                       |                |

#### 4.9.2 Negation particles

The two negation particles kari 'not' (NEG) and balu 'desist, give up' (NEG2), see §3.9.2 (ii), have different application possibilities according to their semantic content.

(i) Particle kari (see also function as privative suffix in §4.6.2 and discourse particle 'but, however' in §4.3.2 and §5.5.3) may negate various clause constituents depending on word order and stress. When negating the predicate, kari bears primary clause stress and immediately precedes the verb or the 0 NP:

(593) Ngayu jungkalu k'ari dumbarri-ny. I sg.NOM(A) billycan.ABS(O) NEG break-PAST

or:

N gayu k'ari jungkalu dumbarriny. 'I did not break the billycan.'

If a noun in subject or object function is to be negated, kari is preferred to follow this noun, but it is the noun which bears primary stress:

- (594) Ngayu j'ungkalu kari dumbarriny. 'I did not break the billycan [but something else].'
- (595) N'gayu kari jungkalu dumbarriny. I did not break the billycan [but something else did].'
- (596) D'ubu kari kankaday, dingkar. Not a ghost is coming, [but] a man.'

Compare (596) to (597), where kari is stressed:

# 1 98 Chapter 4

(597) Dubu kari k'ankaday, dungandungay. 'The ghost is not coming, [but] going. '

If an adjective is to be negated, kari may precede this, in which case kari is stressed, or it may follow the adjective, in which case the adjective is stressed:

(598) a. Ngayu k'ari dakuy. 'I am not hungry'

b. Ngayu d'akuy(-)kari.

In (598b) kari can probably be interpreted as privative suffix which means that the adjective + -kari as a whole has predicator function. The same interpretation of kari as privative also applies with adjectival particles which are invariably followed by it (see §3.9. 1 .).

(ii) Particle balu has a somewhat ambiguous grammatical status. Its syntactic behaviour is like that of adjectival particles in that it governs a noun in dative case or a purposive clause, and the subject NP in a balu sentence is always in S function (see syntax of adjectival particles in §4.9.1). On the other hand, balu does not have the morphological possibilities of adjectival particles, i.e. verbal stem-formation, privative, and combination with -bajaku 'very'. (For morphology of adjectival particles see §3.9.1 .) Because of these morphological differences I do not include balu among the adjectival particles.

The negation function of balu as 'desist, give up, refrain' is illustrated in the following examples:

| (599) | Nyulu                                                                     | warru         | balu | dama-nka   | ngawuya.      |
|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|------|------------|---------------|
|       | 3sg.NOM(S)                                                                | yg.man.ABS(S) | NEG2 | spear-PURP | turtle.ABS(O) |
|       | "The young man could not spear the turtle." (i.e. he made an unsuccessful |               |      |            |               |
|       | attempt at spearing it and gave up)                                       |               |      |            |               |

- (600) N gayu balu kuniwa-nka. I sg.NOM(S) NEG2 fight-PURP "I don't like fighting." (i.e. I disapprove of fighting and refrain from doing it myself)
- (601) Ngayu balu buymbi-nka. I sg.NOM(S) NEG2 sucklsmoke.tobacco-PURP "I don't like to smoke." (i.e. I know it is bad for my health and therefore abstain from it)
- (602) N gayu balu mayngku-ku wawumu-ku. I sg.NOM(S) NEG2 mango-DAT half.ripe-DAT "I don't like half-ripe mangoes." (i.e. they give me indigestion and I therefore refrain from eating them)

The contrast between balu and kari is that kari simply negates whereas balu implies a certain reason, i.e. inability or disapproval, why something is not done. Balu also differs from wawu-kari 'don't want, don't like' in that it indicates disapproval as a general principle whereas wawu-kari has more specific reference. Compare (601) with the following:

(603) Ngayu wawukari buymbi-nka. 'I don't want/don't like to smoke.' (perhaps because I have a cold, but normally I do smoke)

Consider also the 'collateral' discourse function of balu (see §5.5.3) as indicating a false assumption, i.e. 'give up a preconceived idea (because of contrary evidence)', and balu in imperatives as 'leave it be, desist from what you are doing' (see §4.7).

### 4.9.3 Other particles

The use of co-ordination particles kari and yamba 'but, however', kunka and nganganjirrka 'in case', and kaki 'if, when' has been illustrated in §4.3.2. The two remaining particles that need further consideration are comparison particle yala, and nguba 'perhaps, maybe'.

(i) Comparison particle yala '(be) like, (be) the same' (COMP) (see §3.9.2 (i» , is followed by an NP in absolutive case, or nominative case if a pronoun, for example:

| (604) | Nyulu                           | yala | nyungu       | nganjan.   |
|-------|---------------------------------|------|--------------|------------|
|       | 3sg.NOM(S)                      | COMP | 3sg.POSS.ABS | father.ABS |
|       | 'He is (just) like his father.' |      |              |            |

- (605) Eskimo mala-minya yala bama. eskimo.ABs(S) expert-meat COMP Aborigine.ABS 'Eskimos are expert hunters like Aborigines.'
- (606) Ngayu wawu jirray mayi-ka yala mayngku. I sg.NOM(S) like much fruit-DAT same mango-ABS 'I like very much fruit [that is] like a mango.'

Note that in other comparison constructions that do not contain particle yala the compared component takes dative case; see §4. 1 .4.4 (ii).

R. Hershberger (1 979:82-83) attested yala in an additional function as co-ordination particle, for example:

(607) N gayu mayi wundi-ny yala nyulu ngadiku I sg.NOM(A) food.ABS(O) bring-PAsT COMP 3sg.NOM(A) long. ago wundi-ny. bring-PAST 'I brought food like he brought it long ago.' (quoted from Hershberger; my spelling and glosses)

But sentences of this type were not whole-heartedly accepted by my informants. Because of the insufficient evidence I have not included yala among the co-ordination particles.

(ii) Particle nguba 'perhaps, maybe' indicates that the speaker makes an assumption which may or may not hold true, or that he presents possible alternatives, for example:

- (608) Jana wanjabu? N guba jana ngaki-ji-y. 3pl.NOM(S) where maybe 3pl.NOM(S) hide-REF-NONPAST 'Where are they? Maybe they are hiding.'
- (609) Nguba ngayu nyiku kada-y-baja, nguba wunkuny. maybe I sg.NOM(S) today cOme-NONPAST-again maybe tomorrow 'Maybe I come back today (or) maybe tomorrow. '

## 200 Chapter 4

(6 1 0) N guba ngayu kuyu nyama-l, nguba dinda-l. maybe I sg.NOM(A) fish.ABs(o) stew-NONPASf 'Maybe I 'll stew the fish, maybe [I'll] roast it. ' maybe roast-NONPASf

As can be seen in the above examples, nguba always precedes the expressed assumption or alternative.

# 4.10 Interjections

Interjections usually make up a complete utterance, or else precede a sentence. In the latter case they are set off from the rest of the utterance by a slight pause. Some interjections are monosyllabic and/or end with a glottal stop or breathy voice. In this respect they differ from the normal phonology and word pattern in Kuku Yalanji. Interjections with an approximation of their meaning are:

| yuwu      | 'yes'                                                                                                             |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
