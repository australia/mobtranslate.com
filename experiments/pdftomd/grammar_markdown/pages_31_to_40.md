### 1.2. 1. 1 Tribal groups and names

The language name may be used in unchanged form to refer to a native of a Kuku Yalanji-speaking area. As is characteristic of Australian Aborigines, Kuku Yalanji society is closely associated with the land to which they belong. Thus a distinction is made between six groups or 'mobs' which "were and are identified with particular territorial tracts focused more or less on river drainage areas" (Anderson 1 980:78). Members of different 'mobs' used to congregate for ceremonies or when a particular food was abundant in a certain area. They still do so today for festivities that either are arranged spontaneously or are linked to the European calendar, such as Christmas.

Within each 'mob' there are several descent groups associated with "patrilineally inherited relatively boundary specific 'countries' or bubu" (Anderson 1 980:78). These groups are known by the name of their 'country', e.g. banabila-warra 'inhabitants of Banabila (near the mouth of the Bloomfield River)', or wujalwujal-warra 'inhabitants of Wujal Wujal (the mission site on the Bloomfield River), (see Hughes' 1 886 list of tribal names for Weary Bay). The descent group is obliged to care for and maintain their 'country', which usually contains one or more sites of spiritual or mythological significance. These sites are called yirmbal 'story place'.

An overall distinction which encompasses 'mobs' and descent groups is made according to ecological features of the territory, e.g. majaji 'with rainforest' versus ngalkalji 'with open woodland' for rainforest and woodland dwellers, andjalunji 'with sea' versus bana yiralji 'with fresh water' for seashore and river dwellers.

# 1.2. 1.2 Personal names

All members of the Wujal Wujal community now have English first names and surnames. Most people over about 60 years of age also have Aboriginal names, but they are reticent about disclosing them and people are rarely called openly by their native name. Only some native language nicknames are in general use, e.g. jina-baji 'sore foot' for a person who had his foot injured by a stonefish when a young boy.

# 1.2. 1.3 Social structure and marriage

Each Yalanji and Nyungkul speaker belongs to one of two moieties: walarr or dabu, both also referring to bee species. The main totems of these moieties are birrmba 'white cockatoo' and kumurrbina 'black cockatoo' respectively (see W. Oates & L. Oates 1 964a).

A correct marriage partner belongs to the opposite moiety, and children belong to the same moiety as their father. Owing to an overall decrease in number of the KukuYalanji people and earlier interference by missionaries, as well as a somewhat more liberal point of view among the majority of the younger generation (but by no means all of them), it is not always possible nowadays for a 'right' marriage to be arranged. However, if a marriage turns out not to be a happy one, this is generally blamed on the fact that the partners are not 'right' according to tradition.

Formerly, a man could have as many wives as he could support, bearing in mind that he also had to provide to some extent for his in-laws.

#### 12 Chapter 1

Each family member had an intrinsic right to a particular portion of the available food which ensured that provision was made for those who could not fend for themselves, such as the elderly or sick. This convention of obligatory sharing has been extended to money supplies and is still adhered to in the present community (but unfortunately it is now often subject to abuse, according to my informants.)

The relationship between a man and his mother-in-law was and is subject to total avoidance, that is they may not speak to each other or even be in the same room. Less strict taboos apply to other in-law relationships, where the persons concerned may converse but not, for instance, touch each other. These taboos have created some problems in the running of the community, since for instance the local buLiman 'policemen' will refuse to take, say, a drunken father-in-law into custody, and a mother- or son-in-law will miss out on her or his old age pensioner meal, because they must not be together in the room where the meals are served.

There is evidence that an avoidance language was formerly used among certain in-law relations, although it is not clear to which relationships this applied. The last person to know this avoidance style died many years ago and no records of this speech style exist. <sup>10</sup>

# 1.2. 1.4 Food

KukuYalanji territory on the whole had ample food resources. Particularly the rainforest region and coastal strip provided abundant and reliable food supplies, such as fruit and nuts (e.g. bush cherry, blue quandong, wild apple, figs, zamia nut, Moreton Bay chestnut), roots (e.g. yams and wild ginger), wild honey, smaller mammals (e.g. possums and bandicoot), birds and eggs (e.g. scrub hen, cassowary, Torres Strait pigeon), goannas, pythons (poisonous snakes were not eaten), fresh- and saltwater varieties of turtles, fish, and shellfish, crustaceans and insects (e.g. green ant, witchetty grub) (see Anderson 1 979; Roth 1 90 1- 1 905 and 1 907-1910).

Fish, shellfish, turtles and scrub hen eggs as well as some plant foods are still in relatively good supply and are often obtained to supplement the European diet (see Anderson 1 980). A new 'natural' food resource is mangoes and wild pigs, whereas cassowaries, native mammals and pythons have all but disappeared since the introduction of the poisonous cane toad in the area.

Preparation of some plant foods such as zamia nut and hairy yam required elaborate preparation, including roasting, pounding into flour and subsequent leaching in water for several hours (see Roth 1 90 1- 1 905 and 1 907-1 910). In the case of zamia nut, leaching is required to extract the poisonous substance, whereas hairy yam needs to be soaked in water to remove the unpleasant taste. Such labour-intensive foods are rarely prepared today; they have been replaced by white bread and damper.

Meat and fish used to be roasted in a ground oven between hot stones and various types of leaves (see Roth 1 901-1905 and 1 907- 1 910, see also Text 51 in the appendix) and this is still a popular and tasty way of cooking, particularly for freshwater eels, during 'walkabout' expeditions. Boiling in a bark trough or a large shell was a traditional mode of cooking food in the Bloomfield River region but apparently unknown anywhere else in North Queensland.

<sup>10</sup>In the closely related language Guugu Yimidhirr an avoidance speech style is still used between brothersin-law. A description of this can be found in Haviland (1979a, 1979b). However, it would be mere conjecture to assume that the Kuku Yalanji avoidance style was in any way similar.

Cannibalism was not unknown among the Kuku Y alanji, but was only practised when people were driven by hunger. The victim was not killed for that particular purpose, but was eaten after death by natural causes or in a fight. As Roth (1901 :30) reports:

... there was no special distinguishing term for cannibalism, which had no special ceremony attached to it, was not confined to any particular members of the tribe, and was only resorted to when compelled by hunger. There was, however, one instance recorded here [in the Bloomfield River District] where the natives ate the killed on the battle field, both sides joining in the repast, and subsequently resuming the fight.

On the Palmer River, where the huge influx of European and Chinese miners during the gold rush quickly destroyed woodland, rivers and waterholes and with them the resources of game and fish, the Aborigines were soon forced to find alternative food supplies in the form of the miners' animals and the miners themselves. Stories of cannibalism on the Palmer River abound and my informant Charlie Tayley was able to tell me (from hearsay) that Chinese were regarded as better eating than Europeans and that a slain enemy was further utilised by fashioning his skull into a billycan (see Anderson & Mitchell 1 981).

### 1.2. 1.5 Artefacts

Different types of dillybags and traditional hunting weapons such as fish and turtle spears are still made and used today, but metal has replaced the traditional materials for spear prongs and hooks.

# 1.2. 1.6 Medicine

Minor ailments were and largely still are treated with bush medicine, such as yangka 'green ant Guice)' for fever, colds and stomach upsets, or poultices from stewed bark of kabal 'Leichardt tree' or leaves of jujubala 'ironwood tree' applied to a limb for rheumatic pain. In severe or chronic cases of illness the rrunyuji or murri doctor was called upon. He would extract 'by magic' a 'thing', usually a stingray barb or in later times a marble, from the patient's body. This 'thing' was believed to be the cause of the illness and the patient was expected to get better after its removal. One of my informants claimed that some years ago she had been cured in this way from an abdominal complaint after unsuccessful treatment by European doctors. A murri doctor with such healing powers was said to live in Cooktown in the early 1980s and was still consulted as a last resort if western medicine proved ineffective.

# 1.2. 1.7 Taboos

Taboos applying to in-law relationships have been mentioned in ยง 1 .2. 1 .3 above. Food, either from certain places or obtained by particular family members, may also be subject to taboo. Any game or fish from the north-eastern part of Weary Bay, for instance, is believed to bring about severe illness and must not be eaten. My informants repeatedly warned me against fishing in this area, illustrating their argument with examples of cancer and paralysis that had befallen both Aborigines and white settlers who had not heeded this taboo.

#### 14 Chapter 1

Food collected by a family member is taboo to certain siblings. For instance, a woman is not supposed to eat meat or fish obtained by her younger brother, and a man should not eat certain plant foods and eggs gathered by his younger sister. This rule is still largely observed, whereas another taboo that forbade certain types of game for children and adolescents does not apply any more. (As one of my informants put it: "The old people just wanted to keep the best food for themselves".)

Mention of the name of a deceased person was proscribed totally in former times for as long as the body was decomposing. (The corpse was wrapped in bark and placed in a tree under which a fire was maintained until "only the bones were left". These were then carried around for a while by family members before being buried.) During the decomposition period the name was replaced by the substitute term ngalba in reference to the deceased as well as living persons with the same name. !! Nowadays, the substitute term plus the name, e.g. ngalba 'Ivy', is generally used, whereas family members refer to the deceased only by a kinship term. A recently deceased person is talked about as little as possible and tape recordings, for instance, of such a person must on no account be listened to.

### 1.2. 1.8 Other customs and beliefs

Initiation practices such as piercing of the nasal septum, front tooth extraction and 'marking' with cicatrices have gradually been discontinued over the last sixty years or so, incidentally much to the relief of those people who just managed to avoid such painful operations in their youth.

Persistent offenders, e.g. thieves or breakers of sexual or other taboos, used to be speared, sometimes even to death, according to the severity of their crime.

A common 'magic' practice was the kanyil 'curse song'. The last (reported) kanyil was performed in the late 1 930s. If a person was wronged by someone else, for instance in cases of adultery, he/she would 'sing' the offender(s), which was believed to ultimately bring about the culprit's death (see W. Oates & L. Oates 1 964a).

A person's death was often thought to be caused by sorcery. It was believed that the dead person's belongings would attract the 'spirit' of the sorcerer. This spirit could only be seen by the rrunyunji who would hold watch until the murderer's spirit appeared. Once the murderer was identified, the dead person's family had the duty to avenge their relation by spearing. (Oates and Oates 1 964a report a different way of detection by pointing a stick.) This type of magic and punitive measure has not been practised for many years.

A source of great fear even today are thunderstorms, which usually begin in early November and increase in frequency and intensity until the beginning of the wet season towards the end of December. Some actions are thought to bring about a thunderstorm, e.g. trespassing on a sacred site. Certain practices were and are believed to drive away the storm, such as burning ironwood leaves or turtle skin.

Some 'messenger' birds are accorded great importance, as for instance wakuka 'kookaburra', who is thought to herald the death of a family member.

<sup>11</sup>Ngalba is not etymologically transparent in Kuku Yalanji, but it is presumably cognate to Guugu Yimidhirr ngalba- 'hide, be hidden'. The use of a particular word that is reserved for the sole purpose of substituting a tabooed name is attested only for central Australia, western Queensland and Cape York Peninsula. For a discussion of this strategy in central Australia, see Nash and Simpson (1981).

One of the spirits still believed in is wuyngkul, the spirit of a sick person close to death, who moves about intent on mischief such as causing accidents or sudden pain. It is visible to specially gifted people and will disappear again on the death or recovery of the sick person. During my stays on the Bloomfield River several older people attributed minor accidents or pains to a wuyngkul that was thought to be abroad.

Creation myths of Yalanji and Nyungkul speakers centre on mythical beings which have become associated with certain geographical features. Some of these are kija 'moon', who created women at kijandaku 'Roaring Meg Falls'; kurriyala 'carpet snake, ' who died and is buried at mangkal 'Cedar Bay'; ngurrku 'mopoke'; and bajabaja 'blue tongue lizard', whose eggs hatched in the Bloomfield River bed, dry at the time, and later turned into two prominent rocks in the river. The origin of all rivers and creeks in the area is thought to be the amniotic fluid of one of two sisters who gave birth on ngalbabulal 'Mount Pieter Botte', about halfway between Bloomfield and Daintree.

A spirit which is associated with one particular Yalanji family clan is wadalwadal, a water spirit with female body and fishtail, living in a spring in the Thompson Creek valley. It will not suffer trespassers on its site, but tolerates members of the family who rightly belong there and who may use the spring water that is believed to have healing powers.

### 1.2.2 Recent history

The earliest mention of Aborigines in Weary Bay was made by the explorers Cook ( 1 770) and King ( 1 819, 1 821) who noticed signs of habitation such as campfires and canoes, but saw no people. The first inland explorer William Hann reached the Bloomfield region in 1 872 and reported several encounters with Aborigines, which were generally friendly.

From 1 873, with the discovery of gold on the Palmer River and later tin in the Annan River region, European migration into KukuYalanji territory increased suddenly and dramatically, but its impact was markedly different on the eastern and western tribal groups.

West of the Great Dividing Range where the Palmer River and Hodgkinson gold fields attracted thousands of European and Chinese miners, the Kuku Yalanji fought a fierce but losing battle for survival. Alluvial gold mining in the rivers deprived them of their supplies of water and fish, and game resources were quickly depleted by the environmental impact of the sudden huge alien population with their horses and cattle. Hostile encounters predictably resulted in the death of large numbers of Aborigines and the few successful attacks by the natives had no significant effect other than leading to punitive measures by the Europeans. The open country afforded little protection for the Aboriginal population, who was soon reduced to a few remnants.

East of the Great Dividing Range the Aborigines stood a much better chance of survival for two reasons: firstly, the main attraction of gold was lacking in this region and the influx of Europeans was only slight compared to the Palmer River area. Secondly, the rugged mountainous country covered with virtually impenetrable rainforest prohibited any significant spread of European population while at the same time providing the Aborigines with reliable water supplies, largely undisturbed food resources and, not least, possibilities for concealment. As Anderson (1 979:34) states:

Because of the relative isolation of the Bloomfield River district and due to its extremely rugged terrain and dense vegetation, encounters between Aboriginal people and white settlers were minimal and of a relatively peaceful nature,

# 16 Chapter 1

# and ( 1 979:36):

Due to the nature of the Bloomfield terrain and the types of European activity there, Aborigines could more or less control the amount of interaction they had with whites.

In the late 1 880s there were about 1 200 Europeans in the area between the Annan and Daintree River, mostly tin miners, but also Red Cedar loggers and settlers involved in agricultural enterprises such as sugar, tobacco and coffee plantations. None of these encroached significantly on Aboriginal territory.

Relations between Aborigines and Europeans in this area gradually developed into some form of mutual assistance. Europeans recognised a source of cheap labour in the Aborigines and the latter in turn were quite partial to the commodities that they received as payment, e.g. tobacco, flour, sugar, and tea, and even came to rely to some extent on European food supply. Reliance on foreign food developed mainly because Aboriginal males working for Europeans often spent time away from their tribal groups which deprived their families of their main providers of game and fish. To compensate for this, women often agreed to sexual relations with nearby white miners or loggers who would provide them with food for their families. This was usually done with the consent of the Aboriginal husbands (see Anderson 1 979:35).

Later on, beche-de-mer and pearl shell fishing off the east coast also used Aboriginal labour, but recruiting practices for these enterprises were often of a dubious nature. Boys and young men were either kidnapped by white fishers or sold off by older men of their tribes (see Anderson 1 979:35; J. Haviland and L. Haviland 1 980: 1 34; Loos 1 980).

In 1 8 86 the Queensland Government gazetted a 'Reserve for Aborigines' of about 640 acres as well as a hunting reserve of about 30,000 acres, against the opposition of local settlers who felt that the land could be more gainfully utilised. (An assumption which incidentally was proven wrong by history, since all larger agricultural enterprises in the area failed owing to poor soil and the difficulty of marketing produce because of transport difficulties from this isolated area.)

In 1 887 the Lutheran church was given control of the reserve in an attempt to settle and 'civilise' the Aborigines through regular employment and schooling, but this attempt failed and the mission was abandoned in 1 902. The mission site had proved unsuitable for agriculture and Aborigines never remained on the mission for long. They preferred to control their own lives, which was possible partly through traditional subsistence patterns and partly through symbiotic relationship with European settlers, who did not require the commitment that was expected by the missionaries. There is even evidence that Aborigines, being aware of their own value as labourers, played off the Europeans against each other (Anderson 1 979:36).

For the following fifty years Yalanji and Nyungkul people suffered relatively little interference (compared to other regions in Queensland) from their 'protector', the Queensland Government. Throughout this time Aborigines always slightly outnumbered the European population and continued their assimilation of tribal and European subsistence patterns, congregating in several major camps usually in the vicinity of European settlements. After World War II they moved, or were moved, into the greater Bloomfield valley where a mission station was reopened in 1 956 under the administration of the Queensland Lutheran Mission Board. By 1 988 the population of Wujal Wujal numbered about 3 30.

Since the 1 950s three factors have had an increasingly detrimental effect on the wellbeing of the community: traditionally antagonistic tribal groups now living together, a great reduction in accessible tribal land and lack of self management. 12 In March 1 987 a young man killed himself while detained in the Wujal Wujal watchhouse. The resulting inquiry as part of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody recounted a disturbing story of an Aboriginal community under threat. Access to traditional lands had been greatly curtailed because of "tourist development, real estate speculation, mining and commercial fishing industries and conservationist interests" (Wyvill 1 990:9). Tensions within the community could no longer be alleviated by spreading out on socially productive hunting, fishing and food gathering trips but were acerbated by poor and cramped living conditions, unemployment, alcohol abuse and a general feeling of boredom and frustration (see Wyvill 1 990).

It is therefore heartening to find that at the turn of the millennium Wujal Wujal, now governed by its Aboriginal Community Council, is a growing and apparently optimistic community. Community Development Employment Projects (Commonwealth Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs) provide employment opportunities; the Women's Centre produces arts and crafts for the tourism trade; the Wujal Wujal Kindergarten has about ten children in the care of Aboriginal teachers. Also, the fact that an illegal alcohol outlet close to the 'dry' community disbanded some years ago can only be beneficial.

### 1.2.3 Summary

Concluding the observations on cultural background and recent history one can say that, while the western KukuYalanji succumbed early to the sudden and massive foreign immigration into their territory, contact in the eastern parts progressed more gradually and relatively non-violently. Initially, this allowed the native inhabitants, Yalanji and NyungkuI, the opportunity to assess and adopt those aspects of European civilisation that appeared desirable and to adjust slowly to a western lifestyle, while at the same time maintaining for a long time much of their cultural integrity based on traditional values, beliefs and subsistence patterns. Developments in more recent years have shown that traditional ways were declining, primarily because of lack of land. It also appeared that white administration of the mission settlement had left the Kuku Yalanji and Kuku Nungkul ill-equipped to cope with the now rapidly changing living conditions. However, most recent developments seem more positive and hopeful with respect to the survival of a viable Aboriginal community on traditional land, albeit very much reduced in area, within the framework of mainstream Australian society and economy.

### 2.1 phoneme inventory

Kuku Yalanji has an inventory of sixteen segmental phonemes, consisting of thirteen consonants and three vowels, which is one of the smallest phoneme inventories found in Australian languages.

# 2. 1. 1 Consonants

Kuku Yalanji consonants are shown in Table 2. 1 represented by IPA symbols as well as the letters used by H. Hershberger and R. Hershberger in their practical orthography for Kuku Yalanji, which will be used throughout this text. The practical orthography devised by the Hershbergers is used in the vernacular program in the Bloomfield River State SchooL There are also a number of SIL publications produced for the community that use this orthography, e.g. booklets on child-care, nutrition etc. In my description of Kuku Yalanji grammar I feel obliged to adopt the symbols that Kuku Yalanji speakers are already familiar with. However, I have made two changes in the spelling of some words. The Hershbergers do not distinguish between final n and ny, representing both sounds as n, because they wanted to avoid confusion with the English spelling and pronunciation of final ny as in many. But since final n and ny are clearly distinct (see minimal pairs further on in this sub-section) I do use both symbols word-finally. I also use final y after vowel i (see ยง2.S.2).

The practical orthography includes one apparently inconsistent aspect. Stop sounds are usually voiced and bilabial and alveolar stops are appropriately represented by letters b and d respectively. The velar stop, on the other hand, is represented by letter k. H. Hershberger and R. Hershberger chose this letter to make an easy distinction between the velar nasal ng and a sequence of alveolar nasal plus velar stop nk.

Stops and nasals in Kuku Yalanji include two peripheral (or non-coronal) series, bilabial and dorso-velar, one apical series and one laminal series. Bilabial stops and nasals are made simply with the lips. The apical series involves the tip of the tongue touching the alveolar ridge as for English [d] and [n]. Stop /d/ may be realised intervocalically as a tap and some speakers have occasionally even been recorded as using a trill [r] in this position. Two words where a trill instead of stop /d/ has been used with some consistency by certain speakers are:

| <i>karray (kaday)</i> | 'come' |
|-----------------------|--------|
| <i>barriy (badiy)</i> | 'cry'  |

|           | bilabial       | apico-<br>alveolar | apico-post<br>alveolar      | lamino-<br>palatal | dorso-<br>velar |
|-----------|----------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| Stop      | <i>b</i> [b/p] | <i>d</i> [d/t]     |                             | <i>j</i> [/c]      | <i>k</i> [g/k]  |
| Nasal     | <i>m</i> [m]   | <i>n</i> [n]       |                             | <i>ny</i> [ล]      | <i>ng</i> [ล]   |
| Lateral   |                | <i>l</i> [l]       |                             |                    |                 |
| Rhotic    |                | <i>rr</i> [r]      | <i>r</i> []1<br>(retroflex) |                    |                 |
| Semivowel |                | <i>w</i> [w]       |                             |                    | <i>y</i> [j]    |

Table 2.1: Kuku Yalanji consonants

In a vocabulary list compiled by missionary Hoerlein around the tum of the century the word 'come' is clearly recorded with a stop: katay. (,Cry' is not included in this list.) On the other hand, note that cognates for 'come' and 'cry' in Dyabugay, the southern neighbour of Kuku Yalanji, both contain a trill: karray, barriy (Patz 1 991), whereas Yidiny, Dyabugay's close genetic relative, has badi- and gada- (Dixon 1 977a), and Guugu Yimidhirr, to the North of Kuku Yalanji, has baadhi- with a lamino-dental stop, and gadaa- (Haviland 1 979a). The trill variant of Idl in Kuku Yalanji has been recorded most consistently among speakers who grew up or still live in Mossman, the traditional boundary area, where speakers of both Kuku Yalanji and Dyabugay had been moved together on a mission station. Thus it may be possible that Dyabugay pronunciation has had some influence on these cognates in Kuku Yalanji. On the other hand, and I regard this as the more likely possibility, Id/ and IITI could be merging in intervocalic position in Kuku Yalanji. Tap [r] (see below) is an allophone of both stop Idl and trill IITI in intervocalic position in present-day Kuku Yalanji. The next stage could be the reinterpretation of intervocalic [r] as trill, a phonetic change which may already have been completed in Dyabugay.

Laminal stop and nasal, Iji and Iny/, are produced by placing the blade of the tongue against the hard palate. The laminal stop is usually realised as an affricate in all environments.

Dorso-velar consonants are realised by the back of the tongue being raised against the soft palate as for English g/k, and ng as in sing.

The following minimally distinct words illustrate the phonemic status of stops and nasals in different places of articulation:

Stops

| bilabial       | bubu | 'land, place'    |
|----------------|------|------------------|
| apico-alveolar | dudu | 'blunt'          |
| lamino-palatal | juju | 'bum'            |
| dorso-velar    | kuku | 'word, language' |

See Ladefoged (1 975) Consonant Chart.

Nasals

| bilabial       | <i>bama</i>    | 'Aborigine'    |
|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| apico-alveolar | <i>bana</i>    | 'water'        |
|                | <i>jalban</i>  | 'tree top'     |
|                | <i>nandal</i>  | 'close, cover' |
| lamino-palatal | <i>jalbany</i> | 'taboo food'   |
|                | <i>nyandal</i> | 'chop'         |
| dorso-velar    | <i>ngandal</i> | 'mouth'        |

Stops are always unaspirated and there is no phonemic distinction between voiced and
voiceless. There is a general tendency for stops to be voiced intervocalically and in
consonant clusters following /l/-, retroflex /r/- and nasals, while in other positions they may
be voiceless.

Like other languages east of the Gulf of Carpentaria (Dixon 1980:143) Kuku Yalanji has
only one lateral, apico-alveolar /l/, which is pronounced with the tip of the tongue touching
the alveolar ridge. After vowels /a/ and /u/ the lateral is slightly velarised, producing a darker
lateral sound similar to [ษซ] in English `table`, for example:

|     | kalal | [1] | 'vine' |
|-----|-------|-----|--------|
| but | milbi | [1] | 'show' |

The two rhotics in Kuku Yalanji are distinguished by place and manner of articulation. For trill Irrl the tip of the tongue vibrates against the alveolar ridge while the retroflex continuant Irl is produced by slightly turning back the tip of the tongue and approaching the roof of the mouth with the underside of the tongue tip. Its pronunciation is similar to the continuant in American 'bird' but without lip rounding. Trill Irrl is usually reduced to a tap [f] in intervocalic position in normal speech (but not in citation forms), whereas it is clearly trilled in other positions, for example:

|     | marra    | [r] or [r] | 'zamia nut'    |
|-----|----------|------------|----------------|
|     | jirray   | [r] or [r] | 'much, plenty' |
| but | ngurrku  | [r]        | 'owl'          |
|     | ngulkurr | [r]        | 'good'.        |

The following minimal pairs illustrate the phonemic status of both rhotics and the lateral:

| malal   | 'spider'                   |
|---------|----------------------------|
| malar   | 'gooseflesh'               |
| maral   | 'girl'                     |
| mararr  | 'sail'                     |
| marral  | 'dry'                      |
| karrarr | 'seaweed'                  |
| karrar  | 'species of bird'          |
| kararr  | 'grass, blanket to lie on' |

The Kuku Yalanji phoneme inventory also contains the two semivowels labial-velar Iwl and palatal Iy/. While semivowel Iwl and vowel lui on the one hand and semivowel Iyl and vowel Iii on the other hand are regarded as articulatory identical pairs, semivowel and vowel
