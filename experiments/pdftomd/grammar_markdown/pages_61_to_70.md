Clauses expressing continuous action by several repetitions of the verb have the following intonation contour. Clause stress falls on the first syllable of the first verb, after which pitch remains at the same level until the end with no final drop, and the very last syllable is distinctly lengthened (see Hershberger & Pike 1970:805), for example:

r---------------------------------------------------

(39) Jana dungany dungany dungany dunga::ny. 'They went on and on and on.' 

(40) Nyulu mayi nukany nukany nukany nuka::ny. 'He ate and ate and ate and ate.' 

3

Intonation contours for polar questions and imperatives are similar to those of statements with final falling intonation, but they differ in level of pitch and particularly in the distance between highest and lowest pitch. If we assume three levels of pitch, the three clauses below can be distinguished as follows: 

(41) *Yundu kaday.*

'You are coming.' (statement)

2
1

2 (42) Yundu kaday? 'Are you coming?' (polar question) 1 --

The difference between pitch levels and, particularly, the difference in the final drop in pitch is clearly distinct for these three types of clauses.

# 3.1 Parts of speech

One can distinguish the following word classes with mutually exclusive membership in Kuku Yalanji:

> Nominals - nouns - adjectives - quantifiers Location and time words Personal pronouns Interrogative pronouns Demonstratives Verbs

Particles

Interjections.

The criteria for this classification are partly grammatical, partly formal, and partly semantic. Grammatical criteria are based on syntactic function, and inflectional and derivational possibilities. A purely formal aspect is open versus closed word class.

## 3. 1. 1 Formal and grammatical criteria

All parts of speech except for verbs, particles and interjections could be considered to be nomina Is in the broadest sense because they all inflect for case. However, the feature of open versus closed word class and differences in inflectional systems and forms invite further subcategorisation.

Demonstratives and pronominal parts of speech are closed word classes with symmetrical paradigms that are ordered according to their semantic content like 'here' and 'there' (demonstratives), person and number (personal pronouns), and 'who', 'what' and 'where' (interrogative pronouns). Particles and interjections also constitute closed word classes to which new members cannot easily be added by speakers of the language.

Nominals, location and time words, and verbs are open word classes; that is, there is room for addition by compounding, derivations and borrowing from other languages.

Members of the nominal, pronominal and demonstrative word classes inflect according to a system of syntactic and local cases. Personal pronouns are set off from the other parts of speech in this group in that they have the same form for transitive and intransitive subject versus a different form for transitive object. The other three classes show a formal distinction between transitive subject on the one hand, and intransitive subject and transitive object on the other hand.

Location and time words occur only in local cases which differ to some extent in form from the local cases of the previously mentioned word classes.

Nominals, and location and time words may form transitive and intransitive verb stems by means of derivations.

Verbs are inflected for tense, aspect and mood; other verbal inflections mark clause subordination which is not indicated by any other means. A verb may be modified by an adverbial particle or an adjective in derived adverbial function.

Particles take no inflections of any kind. According to their function they can broadly be divided into two sub-categories: adjectival particles which may act as predicator, and particles with a modifying, often discourse related, function at clause level.

Interjections stand outside the syntactic framework of a clause or sentence. They are usually uttered just by themselves, or preceding a clause or sentence in a discourse context.

#### 3. 1.2 Semantic content

Generally speaking, nominals refer to objects and properties of objects.

Nouns refer predominantly to corporeal objects, such as human beings (including kinship terms, external and internal body parts and bodily excretions), fauna and flora, geographical and geological items, celestial bodies, weather phenomena, artifacts and other objects of human habitat. Further there are terms for 'imaginable' things, such as ghosts and spirits, several specific terms for different types of noises, and terms for human actions such as language, songs, dances and magic practices. Some bodily and mental states are expressed by nouns (warngku 'sleep', kaka 'pain', kuli 'anger', kuru '(female) love or lust'), while others such as hunger, happiness, desire, etc. are expressed by adjectives, verbs or verbal particles.

Kuku Yalanji nouns include a set of generic terms which can occur on their own or may be used as a kind of classifier in conjunction with another noun (see §4.1.1(c)). These are:

| bama    | 'Aboriginal person'                                                             |
|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| dingkar | 'male'                                                                          |
| jalbu   | 'female'                                                                        |

| jarba   | 'snake'                                                                         |
| kuyu    | 'fish'                                                                          |
| mayi    | 'edible plants (also meal or food in general)'                                  |
| juku    | 'tree (classifies anything wooden such as twigs,sticks, building timber, etc.)' |
| bubu    | 'country, ground, earth, space'                                                 |
| kulji   | 'stone, rock, rock formation (but not mountain)'                                |
| bana    | 'water, liquid'                                                                 |

| muyar  | 'air, wind'                                                                                            |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| baya   | 'fire (also 'firewood' and classifies anything to do with fire such as smoke,<br>matches, hot ashes)'1 |
| kalka  | 'spear'                                                                                                |
| bayan  | 'camp, house, shelter'                                                                                 |
| junjuy | 'something, anything'                                                                                  |

Adjectives denote properties of any nominal referent, for instance size, dimension, value, age, physical and mental characteristics or states, texture, colour, taste, etc. There are three colour terms: ngumbu 'dark', bingaji 'light' and ngalangala 'red, reddish'.

Bingaji also means 'old man', presumably with reference to white hair: the form looks like a comitative derivation with suffix -ji, but it cannot be determined whether the possible root binga means 'light colour' or specifically 'white hair'. N galangala on the other hand could be a reduplicated noun, cf. mulamula 'bright red' derived from mula 'blood', but apparently there is no analysable root ngala.

Note that a number of emotional and physical states are described by noun-verb compounds, e.g. jiba-badiy 'feel sorry, sad (lit. liver-cry)' or wawulay 'feel exhausted' (wawu-wulay 'breath-die').

Quantifiers include numbers nyubun 'one', djambul 'two' and kulurr 'three' and some general terms for quantities such as 'some', 'many', etc. (see §3.2.5).

Location and time words express points of reference in locational and temporal systems, which will be discussed in detail in §3.3.1 and §3.4 respectively.

Semantic content of personal and interrogative pronouns and demonstratives was briefly mentioned in §3.1 .1 and will be detailed further in §3.5, §3.6 and §3.7 respectively.

Verb roots in Kuku Yalanji generally have concrete meaning, referring to motion and rest, perception, voluntary and involuntary utterances, bodily functions, and actions performed on and affecting or effecting an object. Less tangible actions like mental activities are most often expressed by compound verbs. (For more detail see §3.8.2.l, §3.8.5.l and §3.8.5.2).

Particles cover a wide range of meaning, including manner of action, desire, ability, disapproval, negation, uncertainty, conditionality and possibility. The various functions of adverbial, adjectival and discourse particles are discussed in §3.8.6.1 and §3.9.

Interjections comprise yuwu 'yes' and kari 'no', as well as general encouragement, agreement or disagreement. For a full list see §4.1 0.

## 3.2 Nominal morphology

Nouns, adjectives and quantifiers can be distinguished by their semantic content and also on the grounds of some morphological properties. Comparative and intensity markers jarra 'rather, more' and -baja(ku) 'very' only occur with adjectives and quantifiers, while derivational affixes except possessive, comitative and privative are used only with nouns.

H. Hershberger and R. Hershberger ( 1 982) regard baya as a loan word from English 'fire'. This could be possible according to regular phonological adaptation rules (see §2.3), but has not been otherwise substantiated.

Furthermore, quantifiers are distinct from the other two nominal classes in that they take only case inflections from the 'neutral' set.

# 3.2. 1 Case inflections - system

Nominal morphology in Kuku Yalanji distinguishes formally between eight cases, some of which fulfil more than one semantic function. The system of cases and their functions is as follows (for a more detailed discussion see §4. 1 .4):

#### Core syntactic cases

ABSolutive marks the intransitive subject and transitive object of a clause.

ERGative marks the transitive subject.

## Peripheral syntactiC cases

INSTrumental marks the implement that is used by an agent in performing an action.

DATive indicates the goal of a purposeful action, the cause for an action or emotion, or a complement of comparison.

### Local cases

General Locative marks location 'in', 'on', 'at', etc., the goal of a movement (allative), and goal of three-argument verbs 'show', 'give', etc.

ABLative indicates a general source 'from', which is prior in time or location to the action or state referred to in the clause.

ABESSive indicates a locational source, but one which is not left behind by the actor, i.e. a place from which an action is performed.

PERLative is used only in the Nyungkul dialect and marks a defined space through which someone or something passes. (Yalanji speakers use locative case in this function.)

#### 3.2.2 Case inflections -form

Kuku Yalanji has two sets of inflectional allomorphs for all cases except absolutive, instrumental, abessive and perlative. I have termed these inflectional sets 'neutral' and 'potent'. Allomorphs from these sets may be chosen by a speaker according to whether the referent is perceived to be inherently capable of action ('potent' inflection) or not ('neutral' inflection). This distinction largely coincides with the actual 'animacy' or 'inanimacy' of the referent, but does not necessarily have to. (A full discussion of the semantic properties of neutral and potent case inflections is to be found in §4.1 .4.2.)

Case inflections and their allomorphs are listed in Table 3.1 ; examples of inflected nouns illustrating the different allomorphs are given below. Inflections for which there is no distinction between 'neutral' and 'potent' are listed under 'neutral', since this may be regarded as the unmarked set, whereas 'potent' is the marked set (see §4. 1 .4.2).

'Neutral' case inflections do not receive a special gloss in interlinear morpheme translations of example sentences; 'potent' case inflections are glossed as :pt, as in DAT:pt.

Examples of case inflections and their allomorphs:

# 46 Chapter 3

Absolutive case inflection is always zero; that is, the citation form of a nominal coincides with its form in intransitive subject and transitive object function, for example:

# 3.2.2. 1 Historical notes

We can recognise a number of reflexes of pA case inflections in Kuku Yalanji. Proto Australian inflections for ergative, purposive (dative) and locative, as reconstructed by Dixon (1 980:3 1 l ff.), are:

| ergative:  | *-du ~ *-ŋgu ~ *-lu |
|------------|---------------------|
| locative:  | *-da ~ *-ŋga ~ *-la |
| purposive: | *-gu                |

Reflexes of all but pA \*-*lu* and \*-*la* in Kuku Yalanji are:

| neutral ergative | -dV   | < | *-du  |
|------------------|-------|---|-------|
| neutral locative | -ngV  | < | *-nga |
| neutral dative   | -kV   | < | *-gu  |
| potent ergative  | -ngkV | < | *-ngu |
| potent locative  | -ndV  | < | *-da  |
| potent dative    | -nkV  | < | *-gu  |

As can be seen in the above list, Kuku Yalanji 'potent' locative and 'potent' dative have nasal *n* before the pA form. It is interesting to note that in some other languages stems of pronouns and human nouns have an incremental *n* before some non-core case inflections. Warrgamay and Yidiny, for instance, show incremental *n* with pronouns (Dixon 1980:329 and 1 977:1 68-170 respectively). In Dyirbal proper nouns and some common nouns with human reference may take a stem-forming suffix -J1a- after which the dative inflection is -*ngu*, whereas it is -*gu* in other environments (Dixon 1972:43-44). The fact that non-core inflections in these languages have a special form that is used with human referents, that is referents which definitely possess the 'ability to act', may throw some light on the development of 'potent' inflections for locative and dative in Kuku Yalanji. Specifically 'human' inflections in other languages have been generalised in Kuku Yalanji to apply to all 'potent' referents. But the development of the distinction between a 'potent' and a 'neutral' ergative inflection remains unclear.

## 3.2.3 Nominal stem formation

Nominal stems in Kuku Yalanji may be formed from nominal roots by affixation, reduplication or compounding.

Stem-forming affixes include the purely formal catalytic suffix -mun-, a nominalising suffix which derives nouns from verbs, and seven suffixes and two prefixes that add a semantic aspect to the meaning of the root. Derivational affixes may be monosyllabic or disyllabic. Criteria for defining these morphemes as derivational affixes are: (a) they cannot occur independently but have to be attached to a nominal root; (b) root and affix are inseparable, that is no other morpheme such as a clitic may occur between them (but two or three derivational affixes may co-occur); (c) the derived stem may be inflected for case; and (d) the stress pattern defines the derived stem as one word, that is word stress is on the first syllable.
