(361) Yanya mayi ngulkurr nuka-ji-y. this.ABs(s) food.ABS(S) good eat-ITR-NONPASf 'This food tastes nice.' (lit. is good to eat by anyone) 

An agentless passive may of course also imply a chance action as in (362) below which was saId to me by an old lady with a sweet tooth when she saw me setting out with a walkabout party: 

(362) Mayngku nyaji-ji-y, mana! mango.ABS(S) see-ITR -NONP ASf take-IMP ''[If] [you or someone] happen to see any mangoes, take [bring] them!'

R. Hershberger ( 1 1964b:47, 1979:59) reports that the verbs nuka-l ‘eat', baka-l 'dig, poke', yajarri-l 'laugh about' and muja-l 'gather' do not occur in passive, but only in antipassive constructions (see below). I have found that this is not so. Examples of nuka-l and baka-l in passive are given in (36 1) and (346) above. There are, however, semantic restrictions on the use of these verbs in a chance passive because they refer to inherently volitional actions and are therefore unlikely to happen by chance (except baka-l in the sense of 'poke'). If the wrong object were accidentally affected, a transitive sentence with kanban would be used rather than the passive (see above). But these verbs may occur in a topic passive, such as nuka-l 'eat' in (36 1) or munja-l 'gather' in the next sentence. 

(363) Marra munja-ji-ny zamia.nut.ABS(S) gather-ITR-PAST 'Zamia nuts were gathered [by someone].' 

With yajarri-l 'laugh about', on the other hand, a passive, or anti-passive for that matter, is ambiguous. Consider: 

| (364) | Nyulu      | maral       | yajarri-ji-ny        | warru-ndu.    |
|-------|------------|-------------|----------------------|---------------|
|       | 3sg.NOM(S) | girl.ABS(S) | laugh.about-ITR-PAST | yg.man-LOC:pt |

This could be passive,

'The girl was ridiculed (lit. laughed about) by the young man.'

where nyulu maral has underlying O- and warru A-function. But it could just as well be 'antipassive' 

'The girl laughed at the young man [in a friendly way]',

where nyulu maral has underlying A and warru O function. Speakers favour the latter interpretation, which coincides with R. Hershberger's theory at least for this verb. But it is not at all certain that this construction is indeed a true antipassive, hence the inverted commas. This problem will be discussed further in the next subsection. 

### 4.2.4.4 Antipassive

The so-called antipassive is regarded as the ergative language's answer to the passive of the accusative language. According to Silverstein (1976: 140)

... in accusative systems, the patient is regularly expressed in direct transitive constructions by the 'unique' case marking ... the accusative, and in passive constructions this assumes the 'paired' case form, the nominative. Ergative systems have an analogous construction, here termed antipassive , which has all the

## 1 52 Chapter 4

properties of the passive ... The 'unique' case here is the ergative, coding the unique function of direct transitive agent (A), and in antipassive forms the transitive agent is expressed by a surface absolutive (or nominative) case marking, the verb has a change in voice, with a special mark, the transitive object (normally coded by surface absolutive case) appearing at most facultatively in some oblique, adverbial case marking.

Kuku Yalanji does have a construction with the formal properties of an antipassive, but its semantic and pragmatic properties are quite different from that of the passive. It is remarkable that Kuku Yalanji uses both passive and antipassive constructions, a characteristic which is rare but which it shares with its northern neighbour Guugu Yimidhirr.24

In an antipassive construction, as in passive, the transitive verb is intransitivised by stemforming suffix -ji-. The underlying agent (A) appears in S function, taking absolutive or nominative case marking for a noun or pronoun respectively. The underlying transitive object (0) takes locative case in surface structure or even, where appropriate, perlative case. Thus from an underlying transitive structure

|           | [NP1]A      | tr V     | [NP2]O    |
|-----------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| we obtain | [NP1 ABS] S | tr V-ji- | [NP2 LOC] |
|           | NOM         |          | PERL      |

The semantic content of an antipassive construction cannot be captured in one formula, but ample exemplification will be given below. An example of the structural difference between underlying and surface form is:

| (365) a. Nyulu      | dingkar-angka | minya       | nuka-ny. |
|---------------------|---------------|-------------|----------|
| 3sg.NOM(A)          | man-ERG:pt(A) | meat.ABS(O) | eat-PAST |
| 'The man ate meat.' |               |             |          |

b. Nyulu dingkar minya-nga nuka-ji-ny. 3sg.NOM(S) man.ABS(S) meat-LOC eat-ITR-PAST "The man had a good feed of meat (he wasted nothing)."

In syntactically ergative languages like Dyirbal and Yidiny the antipassive is obligatory for sentence co-ordination with co-referential S and A; that is, the sentence containing the A must be antipassivised so that in surface structure co-referential NPs are both in S function (Dixon 1 972:73-74, 1 977:278-279). This is not so in Kuku Yalanji where, as far as coordination is concerned, almost anything goes (see §4.3.1 ). Like passive, antipassive may of course occur in co-ordinated structures, but this is not of syntactic relevance; the antipassive has a different meaning from the transitive sentence.

The antipassive in Kuku Yalanji is used productively for what may be called a 'generalised action', a term coined by Haviland (1 979a:1 32) for the similar use of antipassive in Guugu Yimidhirr. This means that the described action is not discrete and is performed on some general or 'non-individuated'25 object which may or may not be stated in surface structure, that is where transitive sentence condition (4) is not met.26 To indicate

26 Djabugay uses the cognate intransitive suffix -yi- under a similar condition, among other conditions, without however applying antipassive (see Patz 1 99 1 :299).

<sup>24</sup>  The functions of passive and antipassive in Guugu Yimidhirr are similar to those in Kuku Yalanji (see Haviland 1 979a: 1 28- 1 34).

<sup>25</sup>  See Hopper and Thompson ( 1 980:253ff.); this term is discussed further later on in this subsection.

'generalised action' on a 'non-individuated' object the antipassive construction contains a reduplicated verb form as for instance in text 3, lines 39 and 48 and:

- (366) Yinya karrkay kaya-nda kuni-n-kuni-ji-y. that.ABS(S) child.ABS(S) dog-LOC:pt hit-n-REDUP-11R-NONPAST "That little one is hitting all the dogs (around here)."
- (367) Barna dunga-ny bunjurri-ji-ny. Aborigine.ABS(S) go-PAST throw .spitJcurse-11R -PAST 'The Aborigine went and threw curses everywhere. '
- (368) lalbu wukay-rnba nubi-nubi-ji-y. woman.ABS(S) yam-LOC search.for-REDUP-11R-NONPAST 'The woman is looking around for yam.'

(Note that nubi-ji-y in a reflexive construction means 'be lost'.)

(369) lalbu bayan-ba yindu-yinduy-rnbu nuri-nuri-ji-y. woman.ABS(S) house-LOC other-REDUP-LOC peep-REDUP-1TR-NONPAST 'The woman is having a sticky-beak in all the other houses.'

For (366) the generality of the action was made explicit by my informant, whose translation is given above; a similar situation obtains for (369) where the actual houses that are investigated by the woman are not identified. Sentence (368) may be contrasted with

(370) lalbu-ngku wukay nubi-l. woman-ERG:pt(A) yam.ABS(O) search.for-NONPAST 'The woman is searching for yam.'

where the action is more specific and limited than the casual but far-reaching 'looking around' in (368). In (367) the unfortunate targets of the raving man are not even mentioned. Note that as far as co-ordination is concerned, (367) would be equally acceptable as

(37 1) Barna dunga-ny bunjurri-ny. 'The Aborigine went and threw a curse.'

The difference is that in (371) the man cursed only once.

In the Nyungkul dialect, which makes a distinction between locative and perlative, the perlative may also be used in an antipassive construction to express the concept of 'through'. For instance:

(372) Kaya rnayi-burr ngunja-n-ngunja-ji-y. dog.ABS(S) food-PERL forage-n-REDUP-1TR-NONPAST 'The dog is foraging through the food.'

and instead of locative in (369):

(373) lalbu bayan-darr yindu-yinduy-rnburr nuri-nuri-ji-y. 'The woman is having a look through all the other houses.'

If a simple (i.e. not reduplicated) verb form is used in an antipassive in Kuku Yalanji this expresses the semantic aspect of 'total effect on the patient'.27 One such example is (365b)

<sup>27</sup> This is in contrast to the interpretation of antipassive as having "partitive" meaning (see Hopper and Thompson 1 980:263). For further comments see §4.2.5.

# 1 54 Chapter 4

where the man is considered to have "wasted nothing" in the words of my informant. Consider also:

- (374) Ngamu mayi-nga wambi-ji-ny. mother.ABS(S) food-LOC share.out-ITR-PAST 'Mother shared out all the food.'
- (375) Nyulu jalbu ngayku-wun-bu bayan-ba ngunja-ji-ny. 3sg.NOM(S) woman.ABS(S) I sg.POSS-LOC house-LOC take.over-ITR-PAST 'The woman took over my house lock stock and barrel.'

Ngunja-l, also glossed as 'forage' in (347) and (372) refers to the action of claiming or obtaining something that is, or is thought to be, discarded or nobody's particular property.

Use of antipassive with the semantic implications exemplified above is quite productive in Kuku Yalanji. Furthermore, some broadly termed 'verbs of communication' may be intransitivised and in this form require a syntactic construction that is identical to antipassive, i.e. the agent appears in S function, underlying 0 in locative case and the goal of the verbal interaction is added in dative case. The semantic difference between the transitive and the intransitivised verb form may again be interpreted as 'direct' versus 'generalised' action, i.e. the underlying patient is not solely and directly affected by the action but is demoted to an ancillary role. Because the semantic link may be regarded as somewhat remote, particularly in the case of baba-l/babaji-y (see below), I regard the forms in the second column below as 'fixed' intransitive stems similar to the fixed reflexive stems listed in §3.8.5.4 (ii). Consider:

| kunja-l      | 'call, summon' | kunjaji-y      | 'ask someone for something'    |
|--------------|----------------|----------------|--------------------------------|
| walngkurri-l | 'bark at (tr)' | walngkurriji-y | 'pester someone for something' |
| baba-l       | 'try, taste'   | babaji-y       | 'ask someone about something'  |

Janjarri-l 'laugh about, ridicule' andjanjarriji-y 'laugh at in a friendly way' can probably also be included in this list. The link between baba-l and babaji-y can perhaps be interpreted as: babaji-y '� someone's knowledge about something'. The following examples illustrate <sup>I</sup> the use of these intransitive stems:

- (376) a. Dingkar-angka nganya kunja-ny. man-ERG:pt(A) I sg.ACC(O) call-PAST 'The man called me.'
	- b. Dingkar ngayku-ndu mayi-ka kunjaji-ny. man.ABS(S) I sg-LOC:pt food-DAT askJor-PAST 'The man asked me for food. '
- (377) Karrkay ngamu-ndu walngkurriji-ny child.ABS(S) mother -LOC:pt pester .for-PAST 'The child pestered mother for a lolly.' lolly-ka. lolly-DAT
- (378) Buhman warru-ndu babaji-ny kamukamu-ku. police.ABS(S) yg.man-LOc:pt ask.about-PAST alcohol-DAT 'The police asked the young man about the grog.'

In a synchronic study I hesitate to interpret these intransitive sentences as antipassive derivations of underlying transitive constructions. But I would suggest the possibility that at an earlier stage this may have been so and that subsequently the intransitivised verb form has shifted further from the semantic content of the transitive form, being stuck, as it were, with the apparently antipassive construction.

### 4.2.5 Summary and conclusions

To summarise, Kuku Yalanji has an inventory of six derivational processes at clause level, which can be distinguished as optional and obligatory derivations. An optional derivation primarily aims at changing the semantic content of a sentence; a change in syntax is incidental to this primary aim. Optional derivations are inchoative, causative and antipassive. Obligatory derivations are syntactically motivated, mainly by restrictions on the co-referentiality of A and 0 NP in surface structure. Reciprocal and reflexive are derivations of this type.

Passive has a triple function as optional 'chance passive' and 'topic passive' which in tum may be optional or obligatory in certain circumstances. Topic passive can be used optionally to topicalise the 0 NP in a surface structure containing both A and 0 NP. (A transitive sentence with leftmost 0 NP is apparently equally acceptable for this purpose.) Obligatory use of topic passive applies where the underlying agent is omitted in surface structure and this agent is not recoverable from context.

Passive and antipassive with a reduplicated verb form indicate a lower degree of transitivity, i.e. unintentional action, action performed by an unknown or irrelevant or lower animate agent, and generalised action. All this is in accordance with the Hopper and Thompson (1 980) transitivity theory. However, antipassive in Kuku Yalanji does not necessarily have "partitive" meaning, which Hopper and Thompson regard as a characteristic feature for antipassive. "Partitive" may apply for the aspect of generalised action as expressed by the reduplicated verb forms in (366)-(369). However, in sentences (365b), (374) and (375) antipassive with a simple verb form expresses rather the opposite, namely 'total effect'. As in generalised action antipassive, the patient in total-effect antipassive constructions is 'non-individuated', e.g. generic terms in (365b) and (374), and 'my house' (not every bit of furniture specified) in (375). 'Non-individuated' object is thought to be another indication of low transitivity (Hopper and Thompson 1 980:253ff.), but it is not a characteristic feature of antipassive in Kuku Yalanji since it may apply just as well in transitive sentences. Thus antipassive in Kuku Yalanji has the unusual dichotomy that it implies higher transitivity (total effect) or lower transitivity (generalised action) than a corresponding transitive sentence.

Since passive and antipassive in Kuku Yalanji have almost entirely semantic motivation and are not required for syntactic purposes in subordination and co-ordination their existence is no indication of whether Kuku Yalanji has ergative or accusative syntax. To anticipate the findings in the next subsections and also in §5.3.2. 1 -§5.3.2.4 there is no discernable pivot NP in Kuku Yalanji, such as AlS in accusative Western Australian languages (Dench 1 982) or S/o in ergative Dyirbal (Dixon 1 979:62-63), according to which coordinated and subordinated clauses have to be modified. This freedom in co-ordination and subordination could be an indication that the language is syntactically in flux, containing aspects of both ergative and nominative/accusative syntax.28

<sup>28</sup> Similar situations are found in Guugu Yimidhirr (Haviland 1 979a:1 28ff., 1 56ff.) and Yidiny, about which Comrie (1981: 1 08) comments: " ... the Yidiny material illustrates particularly clearly ... that it is misleading to classify a language as being either ergative or not, rather one must ask: to what extent, and in what particular constructions is the language ergative ... " .

#### 4.3 Sentence co-ordination

Co-ordinate structures in Kuku Yalanji consist of two or more clauses of independent status, i.e. clauses which may just as well occur on their own, that are linked together by a specific intonation pattern. The distinguishing feature of co-ordinate versus subordinate constructions in Kuku Yalanji is the verbal inflection. In co-ordinate sentences we find only past or nonpast tense marking, irrealis, or imperative. All other verbal inflections mark a clause as subordinate (see §4.4). (While purposive may occur in an independent clause, two co-ordinated clauses cannot both have purposive inflection.)

Usually, in a co-ordinate structure the constituent clauses are simply juxtaposed. However, there are a few particles and clitics which appear in co-ordinate sentences and add a certain semantic link to the conjoined clauses.

#### 4.3. 1 Simple conjoining

Clauses are conjoined in discourse in order to convey some temporal or logical connection; they may or may not share a common NP.29 In co-ordinate structures without a common NP the described actions may be simultaneous or successive, whichever is the more logical interpretation. The only indication for co-ordination, as opposed to a sequence of several independent clauses, is intonation: there is a rise at the end of each non-final clause and falling intonation after the final clause. (For intonation patterns see §2.6.3.)

- (379) Ngayu jilba-dunga-ny, nyulu bayan-ba bundanda-ny. I sg.NOM(S) walk-go-PAsT 3sg.NOM(S) house-LOC sit.REDUP-PAST 'I went for a walk andlwhile he stayed at home.'
- (380) Babarr-angka mayi waju-l, jinkurr-ungku eZ-ERG:pt(A) food.ABS(O) cook-NONPAST yZ-ERG:pt(A) ngawa nyaji-l-nyaji-l. baby.ABS(O) look-l-REDUP-NONPAST 'Elder sister is cooking food andlwhile younger sister is watching the baby.'
- (38 1) N gayu yarraman karrba-l, yundu daka-l. I sg.NOM(A) horse.ABS(O) hold-NONPAST 2sg.NOM(S) climb-NONPAST 'I hold the horse andlwhile you climb up. ' (i.e. on the horse; daka-l is intransitive)

Co-ordinate structures without co-referential NPs are not all that frequently used in Kuku Yalanji. A much more common stylistic device in discourse, particularly in narratives, is the so-called topic chain. Where the S or A NP, i.e. the topic or pivot of a clause, refers to the same actor as the S or A NP of a number of immediately following clauses, it is normal practice to delete the S or A NP in all but the first clause. Logically such a topic chain refers to successive actions since it is unlikely that someone would perform several actions at the same time. Note that in Kuku Yalanji there is no restriction on the co-referentiality of A and S which means that transitive and intransitive clauses can be co-ordinated without any obligatory change in the transitivity value of the verb. (Anaphoric topic deletion in discourse is considered more fully in §5.3.2 with references to the appended texts.) Some examples of co-ordination possibilities are:

29 See 'Sequence Sentence' and 'Apposition Sentence' in Kuku Yalanji, R. Hershberger (1970:8 1 3-816).

(382) Nyulu yindu nyunba-ny-baja, kangkal-kangkal 3sg.NOM(S) other.ABS(S) turn.back-PAsT-again own.child-REDUP.ABS(O)

'The other one turned back again, fetched her many children, brought them down to the camp and showed them.' (from a story about how the cassowary tricked the brolga into killing her young ones)

(383) Yundu kada-nyaku, nganya nyaji-nyaku. 2sg.NOM(S) come-IRR I sg.ACC(O) see-IRR '[If] you had come, you would have seen me.'

In the above examples the initial clause is intransitive followed by transitive ones.

(384) Bula warru-ngku nambarr kulba-ny, 3du.NOM(A) yg.man-ERG:pt(A) bamboo.ABS(O) pull. out-PAST kaja-ny, dunga-ny-baja. wrap.up-PAST gO-PAST-again 'The two young men pulled out the bamboo, wrapped it up and went on again.' (from a story of how the native bamboo came to grow all over the Cape York Peninsula)

Here the first two clauses are transitive and the last one is intransitive.

(385) Nyulu dingkar bunda-ny, minya-nga nuka-ji-ny, 3sg.NOM(S) man.ABS(S) sit-PAST meat-LOC eat-ITR-PAST wunana-ny-da. lie.down.REDUP-PAST -TEMPI 'The man sat down, had a good feed of meat and then had a rest.'

Here all three constituent clauses are intransitive. Note that the second clause is antipassive, not because the common NP has to agree in function, but to indicate 'total effect' of the action (see §4.2.4.4).

The intonation pattern of these topic chains is such that each non-final verb has either level or rising intonation and the last verb falling intonation. Theoretically, any number of actions can be joined together in this fashion as long as the topic remains the same. However, presumably to break the monotony of such a recital, sentence-final intonation is often applied not later than the third verb. If the topic still remains the same for any further actions, the new sentence may be introduced with the appropriate S/A pronoun. But an anaphoric pronoun is not obligatory, even if the intonation pattern clearly distinguishes several separate sentences, i.e. there can be zero-anaphora for topic across the boundaries of consecutive sentences.

If a number of actions are performed by the same agent on the same object, the 0 NP may also be deleted once it has been introduced as in (382) and (384). But some speakers seem to prefer to include an anaphoric pronoun in 0 function every now and again, particularly if the object is animate.

## 1 58 Chapter 4

Sentences may also be intonationally co-ordinated if the S NP, but apparently not the A NP, is co-referential with the 0 NP of the following sentence. It seems that zero anaphora is not possible in this event, but pronoun reduction is required.

(386) Dingkar wala-ny, jalbu-ngku nyunguny kuni-ny. man.ABS(S) enter-PAST woman-ERG:pt(A) 3sg.ACC(O) hit-PAST 'The man came in and the woman hit him.'

If, on the other hand, the second part of a sentence like (386) should be passive in order to imply a chance event, the first S NP is co-referential with the surface S NP of the following passive clause and may therefore be deleted in the second clause:

(387) Dinkar wala-ny, kuni-ji-ny jalbu-ndu. man.ABS(S) enter-PAST hit-1m-PAST woman-LOc:pt 'The man entered and the woman happened to hit [him].'

#### 4.3.2 Co-ordination particles

Kuku Yalanji has four co-ordination particles, which are used to indicate a relationship of 'contrast', 'condition', or 'reason' between two clauses. These particles are always placed at the beginning of a conjoined clause. They are:

| kari and yamba | 'but, however' |
|----------------|----------------|
| kaki           | 'if, when'     |
| kunka          | 'in case'      |

Another particle, nganganjirrka, may be used in free vanatIon with kunka, but more frequently occurs just by itself to express 'x does Y just in case (something might happen)'.

Clauses containing these particles cannot occur independently, at least not out of context. But it would not be justified to class them as subordinate rather than co-ordinate, because their syntactic structure is that of an independent clause. They may be termed 'dependent sentences' according to Waterhouse (1 963). Such constructions do not normally have more than two constituent clauses, which may or may not have a common A or S NP. Deletion of the second S/A NP is not favoured, although possible; pronoun reduction is preferred.

The particles kari and yamba (sometimes yambada or yambala) imply, in broadest terms, some kind of contrast between the actions or states referred to in two clauses, similar to 'but' or 'however' in English. Both particles are glossed as 'but' in translations. Although kari and yamba are freely interchangeable according to my informants, spontaneous use in elicitation and evidence from texts suggest a subtle semantic difference between them. Kari, which is also a negation particle (see §4.9.2), is typically used to introduce an event which has some negative influence on the event described in the related clause.30 The set patterns for such a co-ordinate construction is that the first clause refers to an event that is desired or under way, and the second clause, beginning with kari, contains the event which has a hindering effect on the first:

'x does/wants to do something, but something else happens', for example:

30 See R. Hershberger's (1 970:816-8 1 8) term "implied-action-diverted" for kari and yamba clauses.

- (388) Ngayu buwun-ji dunga-ny, kari muyar junkuji. I sg.NOM(S) boat-COMIT gO-PAST but wind strong 'I went out with a boat, but there was a strong wind.' (I had to tum back)
- (389) lalbu yinya wawu baduri-ji dunga-nka, woman.ABS(S) that.ABS(S) want fishing.line-coMIT go-PURP kari nyulu bambay. but 3sg.NOM(S) sick 'That woman would like to go fishing, but she is sick.' (she can't go)
- (390) N gayu nyaji-nka yinya bama, kari kalakalbay-bajaku. I sg.NOM(A) see-PURP that.ABS(O) person.ABS(O) but far.away-very 'I am trying to see that person, but [he isll am] too far away.' (I cannot see him properly)
- (39 1) Nyulu warru-ngku kuyu mani-ny, kari burrki-n-burrki-n. 3sg.NOM(A) yg.man-ERG:pt(A) fish.ABS(O) get-PAST but fidget-n-REDUP-PAST 'The young man got the fish [on the line], but [it] kept on fidgeting/struggling.' (presumably it got away)

Kari may also introduce an independent sentence in discourse to indicate a contrast to something previously stated. For more on this use of kari as 'collateral' marker in discourse see §5.5.3.

Yamba, on the other hand, is used more spontaneously than kari in the conveyance of some additional and contrastive information on a state rather than an event. Again, the yamba clause is the second constituent in a co-ordinate structure.

(392) Yinya budmandu karrkay, yamba that.ABS(S) portmanteau.ABs(s) small but 'That port (suitcase) is small, but [it] is heavy.' kulngkul. heavy

Speakers are quite happy to exchange yamba for kari and vice versa in the above sentences, so it appears that a semantic distinction, if there ever was one, is losing its significance.

The co-ordination particle kaki introduces a conditional clause and will be glossed as 'if'. Usually, the kaki clause is the first of two co-ordinated clauses, but it may also occur in second position. Co-ordinate structures with kaki apparently cannot occur in the past tense.31

#### 1 60 Chapter 4

(395) Nyulu warngku-wuna-y, 3sg.NOM(S) sleep-lie-NONP AST 'He has a sleep, if he feels tired.' kaki nyulu bangkarr bajaburray. if 3sg.NOM(S) body.ABS(S) tired

To express such a conditional/temporal relationship in past tense the two clauses are simply juxtaposed, for example: 

(396) Nyulu wawula-ny, nyulu warngku-wuna-ny. 3sg.NOM(S) be.exhausted-PAST 3sg.NOM(S) sleep-lie-PAST '(If/when) he was exhausted, he had a sleep.' 

Particles kunka or nganganjirrka 'in case' may be used to introduce a 'hypothetical reason' subordinate clause (see §4.4.4.4), or may link a dependent sentence to a preceding one, for example:

(397) Ngayu bana wundi-l, kunka / nganganjirrka Isg.NOM(A) water.ABS(O) take-NONPAST in.case bana kari baral-darr. water.ABS(S) NEG road-PERL 'I take some water in case there is no water along the road. ' 

Note that if the speaker knows for sure that there is no water on the road a co-ordinated construction such as (397) is not possible, but two independent sentences are used: 

(398) Ngayu bana wundi-l. Yinya-ngkarr Isg.NOM(A) water.ABS(O) take-NONPAST that-PERL baral-darr bana yambakari. road-PERL water.ABS(S) nothing 'I take some water. There is no water at all along the road. ' 

#### 4.3.3 Clitics in co-ordinate constructions

Temporal clitics -da 'then', -(ng) Vrr 'first of all', and kuda 'meanwhile' (see §3.10.1) occur frequently in co-ordinated sentences to specify a particular temporal connection. However, they are not actual indicators of co-ordination. They are used just as often in independent clauses to provide a temporal reference within a wider time setting. Their discourse function in temporal cohesion is explained and exemplified in §5.2.2. 

Clitic -ji ~ -yijin 'in turn' (see §3. 1 0.3), although it may also occur in independent clauses, is more relevant for sentence co-ordination. In this function it indicates an (appropriate) action that may have been prompted by the action of a different actor as stated in the coordinated clause, for example:

| (399) | Nyulu<br>3sg.NOM(A)                                      | ngayku<br>1sg.POSS.ABS(O) | kambi<br>clothes.ABS(O) | julurri-l,<br>wash-NONPAST |
