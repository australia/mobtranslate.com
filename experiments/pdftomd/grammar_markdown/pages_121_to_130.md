| burra-warri-y                 | (stale-run-y)            | 'stagger, lurch'          |

As can be seen in the above examples the verb root warri-y 'run' is frequently used in the formation of compounds. Dama-l 'to spear' is also used relatively often, although its semantic content in compounds is somewhat opaque, except in kunji-dama-l 'to sneeze' where it may refer to the motion performed in sneezing, which is similar to the motion of the arm when throwing a spear. Dama-l also occurs in the only attested verb + verb compound walngka-n-dama-l (hang-spear) 'hang up to dry' where it may have similar reference to the motion involved in throwing, say, clothes, over a branch or line.

### 3.8.5.3 Inchoative stems

Inchoative verb stems may be formed from nominals with the derivational suffix -ma-l or with the intransitive form -maniji-y.

### (i) Inchoative stems with -ma-l

Derivational suffix -ma-l is a highly productive verbaliser which can combine with virtually any nominal root, adjectival particle and, where semantically plausible, with time and location words, for example:

| yalbay      | 'big'            | yalbay-ma-l      | 'grow'                  |
|-------------|------------------|------------------|-------------------------|
| dandi       | 'hard'           | dandi-ma-l       | 'become hard'           |
| kulji       | 'stone'          | kulji-ma-l       | 'turn into stone'       |
| kalka       | 'spear'          | kalka-ma-l       | 'turn into a spear'     |
| manyarr     | 'wife'           | manyarr-ma-l     | 'become a wife, marry'  |
| binal       | 'know'           | binal-ma-l       | 'learn'                 |
| yilay-yilay | 'late afternoon' | yilay-yilay-ma-l | 'become late afternoon' |
| kuwa        | 'west'           | kuwa-ma-l        | 'move westward'         |

- ( 1 74) Wungar ngalangala-ma-ny. sun.ABS(S) faint.red-INCHO-PAST 'There was an eclipse of the sun.' (lit: The sun became faint red.)
- (1 7 5) Juku ngunjil-ma-ny. tree/wood.ABS(S) charcoal-INCHO-PAST 'The wood turned into charcoal. '
- ( 1 76) Nyulu dunga-ny-baja naka-ma-ny. 3sg.NOM(S) gO-PAST-again east-INCHO-PAST 'He went on again and moved eastwards. '

Inchoative stems with -ma-l are clearly derivations and not compounds because they take imperative inflection -ka, used with stems of more than two syllables, and reduplicate as a whole.

Cognates of Kuku Yalanji -ma-l can be found in all its related languages: -ma-l in Guugu Yimidhirr (Haviland 1 979a:65), -mayi-y in Djabugay (Hale 1 976b:239; Patz 1991:272) and -maji-n, with only very limited function, in Yidiny (Dixon 1977a:368).

Nyungkul speakers may use the inchoative verbaliser -ma-l with inflected nouns, for example:

( 1 77) Nyulu wungar-a-ma-l. 3sg.NOM(S) sun-LOC-INCHO-NONPAST 'He is moving into the sun. '

but Yalanji speakers do not favour such constructions (see also ( 1 80) and following comment).

(ii) Inchoative compounds with -maniji-y

Unlike inchoative stems with -ma-l, inchoative forms with -maniji-y must be regarded as compounds because their morphological behaviour in imperative and reduplication corresponds to that of other compounds. The form -maniji-y could be an intransitivised form (see §3.8.5.4(ii)) of causative verbaliser -mani-l, but note that -mani-l, unlike -maniji-y, does not occur with nominals.

The form -maniji-y may attach to inflected nouns or comitative stems as well as roots, but its use is much more limited than that of the derivational suffix -ma-l. It can imply 'become <sup>X</sup>owing to external circumstances' but this interpretation does not always apply. Some examples are:

- ( 1 78) N gayu wulbuman-maniji-ny. I sg.NOM(S) old.woman-INCHO-PAST 'I became an old woman.'
- (1 79) Juma Leonie dunyu-nji-maniji-y. later Leonie.ABS(S) husband-COMIT-INCHO-NONPAST 'Eventually Leonie will get married.'
- ( 1 80) Ngayku bayan wungar-a-maniji-y. I sg.POSS.ABS(S) house.ABS(S) sun-LOC-INCHO-NONPAST 'My house will move into the sun. '

Note that the last example is not a passive clause with 'sun' as agent in locative case because wungaramanijiy is inseparable.

Such inchoative forms are used only infrequently and inchoative derivations with -ma-l are generally preferred. Possibly, an original semantic distinction between the two inchoative forms is becoming blurred, with -ma-l taking over as general inchoative stem-forming suffix.

### 3.8.5.4 Syntactic derivations

There are two derivational processes in Kuku Yalanji which change a transitive verb into an intransitive one. One of these is 'reciprocal', the other is 'reflexive' which is also used to intransitivise verbs in other than reflexive contexts. The change in transitivity goes together with a change in conjugation class: an intransitive stem derived from a transitive l-conjugation verb always belongs to the y-conjugation.

#### (i) RECIProcal -wa-

A reciprocal verb stem is used where two or more participants are involved in the same action on each other. In such constructions the respective agent(s) and transitive object(s) are not referred to individually in these functions, but conjoined in one noun phrase which is in intransitive subject function, and the verb must be intransitivised with 'reciprocal' stemforming suffix -wa-. (For more detail about such constructions see §4.2.3.) Some examples of reciprocal stems are:

| Transitive verb |                | Reciprocal stem  |                    |
|-----------------|----------------|------------------|--------------------|
| nyaji-l         | 'see'          | nyaji-wa-y       | 'see each other'   |
| kunja-l         | 'call, summon' | kunja-wa-y       | 'call each other'  |
| binal-bunga-l   | 'teach'        | binal-bunga-wa-y | 'teach each other' |
| murru-kanga-l   | 'scold'        | murru-kanga-wa-y | 'scold each other' |

(1 81) Jarba bula kaja-wa-y. snake.ABS(S) 3du.NOM(S) tie-RECIP-NONPASf 'The two snakes wrap around each other. ' (i.e. mate)

| (182) | Jana                                                            | bama                               | jalbu-jalbu        | kuni-wa-y         |
|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------|-------------------|
|       | 3pl.NOM(S)                                                      | person.ABS(S)                      | woman-REDUP.ABS(S) | hit-RECIP-NONPAST |
|       | jana                                                            | kuli-kanga-wa-y                    | jurbu-bu.          |                   |
|       | 3pl.NOM(S)                                                      | wild-CAUS-RECIP-NONPAST dance-INST |                    |                   |
|       | 'The women are fighting; they stir each other up with a dance.' |                                    |                    |                   |

Reciprocal stems may of course be reduplicated to indicate continuous action, e.g. kuji-nkuji-wa-y 'keep waiting for each other/looking after each other'. But since reciprocal stems inherently imply a repeated action, reduplication is only used where an abnormally long continuation needs to be indicated. (For reduplication of reciprocal stems see §3.8.S.S (ii).)

Two reciprocal stems, kuni-wa-y 'hit each other' and balka-wa-y 'talk to each other' can occur outside the context of explicit reciprocity, meaning 'fight' and 'chat' respectively, for example:

## 1 04 Chapter 3

( 1 83) Nyulu wawu kari kuni-wa-nka. 3sg.NOM(S) want NEG hit-RECIP-PURP 'He does not want to fight.' (184) Dingkar yinya balka-n-balka-wa-y man.ABS(S) that.ABS(S) speak-n-REDUP-RECIP-NONPAST nyulu kuku-baka. 3sg.NOM(S) language-excess 'That man talks a lot, he is a chatterbox.'

This would mean that although these forms are historically reciprocal derivations, and can be used as such as in (1 82), they also represent separate lexemes with an extended semantic content.

In the Yalanji dialect it is possible to use the reciprocal suffix with some intransitive l-conjugation roots apparently in free variation with the plural subject marker -ri- (see §3.8.5.5 (i» . There is no apparent semantic motivation for this, nor are there syntactic implications.

## (ii) REFlexive/general intransitive (ITR) suffix -ji-

The primary use of stem-forming suffix -ji- is in reflexive constructions. If an agent performs an action on him/herself the coreferential transitive object must be omitted in Kuku Yalanji. The verb is intransitivised with reflexive suffix -ji- and the agent appears in intransitive subject function. (For more syntactic details see §4.2.4.2.) Some examples of reflexive stems are:

| Transitive verb                                                                                                                             |                  | Reflexive stem          |                        |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|
| <i>yaka-l</i>                                                                                                                               | 'cut'            | <i>yaka-ji-y</i>        | 'cut oneself'          |
| <i>jubi-l</i>                                                                                                                               | 'squeeze, pinch' | <i>jubi-ji-y</i>        | 'pinch oneself'        |
| <i>kuli-kanga-l</i>                                                                                                                         | 'excite'         | <i>kuli-kanga-ji-y</i>  | 'excite oneself'       |
| <i>jana-y-mani-l</i>                                                                                                                        | 'make stand up'  | <i>jana-y-mani-ji-y</i> | 'make onself stand up' |
| (185) <i>Dingkar julngka-ji-y warrma-ka.</i><br>man.ABS(S) paint-REF-NONPAST corroboree-DAT<br>'The man paints himself for the corroboree.' |                  |                         |                        |

Similar to fixed reciprocal stems there are a number of reflexive stems which have undergone a semantic shift from the meaning of the corresponding root and are used as separate lexemes in their own right. As I was able to infer from informants' reactions, some of these reflexive stems are hardly connected to the semantic content of the root in the speaker's mind. Thus it is acceptable to say:

( 1 86) Buji jika-ji-y. cat.ABS(S) stretch-REF-NONPAST 'The cat is stretching itself.'

but quite impossible to say:

( 1 87) \*Ngayu buji 1sg.NOM(A) cat.ABS(O) stretch-NONPAST 'I stretch the cat. ' *jika-l*.

since *jika-l* refers exclusively to the action of straightening a spear by heating it in a fire and stretching, bending and turning it. A list of attested reflexive stems that can be regarded as separate lexemes, together with their corresponding roots, is given below:

| Root     |                      | Fixed reflexive stem |                             |
|----------|----------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------|
| balka-l  | 'make'               | balkaji-y            | 'get born'                  |
| jika-l   | 'straighten a spear' | jikaji-y             | 'stretch oneself'           |
| jurrki-l | 'move something'     | jurrkiji-y           | 'move house/camp (oneself)  |
| murni-l  | 'stir'               | murniji-y            | 'spin around/take a detour' |
| nubi-l   | 'search for'         | nubiji-y             | 'be lost'                   |

Stem-forming suffix -ji- is also used to intransitivise verbs in passive and antipassive constructions in Kuku Yalanji. Syntax and functions of such constructions are considered in §4.2.4.3 and §4.2.4.4. (As a general intransitivising suffix in passive and antipassive -ji- is glossed as ITR.)

Kuku Yalanji -ji- is presumably a reflex of a pA verbal suffix \**DHirri-y* and as such a variation of probably the most widespread and productive verbal suffix to be found in eastern and central languages of Australia (see Dixon 1 980:447-449). All reflexes of \**DHirri-y*, e.g. -*Vdhi* in Guugu Yimidhirr, -*yi*- in Djabugay, Kalkatungu and Lardil, *Vji-n* in Yidiny and -*yirri-y* in Dyirbal, have a basic intransitivising function, although the semantic implications differ somewhat from language to language.

## 3.8.5.5 Non-syntactic derivations

Reduplication and plural subject agreement are non-syntactic derivations which, <sup>m</sup> contrast to syntactic derivations, have no impact on the transitivity class of the verb.

#### (i) Plural subject marker -ri-

This suffix is used on intransitive roots or stems of either conjugation to indicate verb agreement with a plural intransitive subject. A -ri-stem cannot, however, indicate by itself plurality of the subject; that is, the subject must be marked for plural by reduplication or a plural pronoun. (For plural formation see §3.2.3.5). The use of -ri- for plural agreement is optional; it appears to be a redundant form.

| Root or stem |               | Plural subject form |
|--------------|---------------|---------------------|
| dunga-y      | 'go'          | dunga-ri-y          |
| janji-l      | 'bathe'       | janji-ri-y          |
| waju-ji-y    | 'burn (REF)'  | waju-ji-ri-y        |
| kuni-wa-y    | 'hit (RECIP)' | kuni-wa-ri-y        |

Examples of sentences with plural subject/verb agreement are:

( 1 88) Jana bama jabajaba wandi-ri-ny. 3pl.NOM(S) Aborigine.ABS(S) all.kinds.ABS(S) emerge-PLS-PAST 'All sorts of people turned up. '

- (1 89) Yurra kada-ri-ka! 2pl.NOM(S) come-PLS-IMP 'You lot, come here!'
- (190) Karrkay-karrkay bayan-ba ngaki-ji-ri-y. child-REDUP.ABS(S) house-LOC hide-REF-PLS-NONPAST 'The children hide in the house. '

gaki-ji-ri-y.
hide-REF-PLS-NONPAST

There are no corresponding verb devices to indicate plural transitive subject or intransitive object. Here, plurality is expressed only by the noun or pronoun form.

#### (ii) Reduplication

Verbal reduplication serves to indicate an ongoing, repeated or habitual action and/or a certain intensity in action, e.g. the reduplicated form of 'see' can imply 'look thoroughly, examine' or just 'keep looking'. In order to express excessively long duration, a verb is simply repeated a number of times without using reduplicated stems; the last vowel of the last verb is usually lengthened considerably, for example:

(191) Jana jalbu-ngku duda-l duda-l duda-l dudaaa-l. 3pl.NOM(A) woman-ERG:pt(A) pound-NONPAST ... 'The women pound and pound and pound and pound.' (i.e. preparing zamia nut)

With verbs of rest 'sit', 'lie' and 'stand' the reduplicated form refers to the state of 'sitting' (also 'living at'), 'lying' (also 'sleeping') and 'standing', whereas the simple root implies 'sit down, lie down, stand up' (i.e. get into posture).

There are different methods of reduplication for simple roots and inchoative stems, other derived stems, and compounds.

#### (a) Reduplication of simple roots and inchoative stems

The regular reduplication process of these involves repetition of the whole root or stem joined by a f ormal link morpheme:

root/stem + link + root/stem + inflection

The link morpheme is -l- for l-conjugation verbs and -n- for y-conjugation verbs.

Reduplicated l-conjugation verbs:

| dinda-l-dinda-l     | 'keep roasting'     |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| karrba-l-karrba-l   | 'keep holding on'   |
| wukurri-l-wukurri-l | 'keep following'    |
| kima-ma-l-kima-ma-l | 'keep getting soft' |

Inchoative stems are generally reduplicated as a whole as in the above example, but many speakers, particularly younger ones, reduplicate such forms analogous to causative or other compounds; that is, they repeat only the stem-forming suffix as in kima-ma-l-ma-l (see R. Hershberger 1 964b:43). Most of the older informants regard the latter form as incorrect, even if they themselves use it frequently.

The three verbs that have suppletive roots for use with imperative inflection also require these alternative roots in a reduplicated imperative form, but not with other inflections:

| nyaji-l-nyaji-l | 'keep looking' |
|-----------------|----------------|
| daji-l-daji-l   | 'keep giving'  |
| mani-l-mani-l   | 'keep taking'  |

nyaka-l-nyaka daya-I-daya mana-I-mana

'keep looking!' 'keep giving!' 'keep taking!'

Examples of reduplicated y-conjugation verbs:

| dunga-n-dunga-y   | 'keep going'    |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| yirrka-n-yirrka-y | 'keep shouting' |

The linking -l- in reduplicated l-conjugation verbs could represent the conjugation marker, but linking -n- in y-conjugation verbs cannot be explained synchronically. But note that the conjugation marker of the predominantly intransitive verb class in Yidiny is - $n$  (Dixon 1977:207). Since y-conjugation verbs in Kuku Yalanji are all intransitive, this - $n$ - may be a remnant of a former n-conjugation which does not now exist in Kuku Yalanji.

Six y-conjugation roots show only partial reduplication of either the first or the second syllable. These are:

(i) Reduplication of first syllable

| badi-y  | 'cry, weep'  | banbadi-y | 'keep crying, weeping' |
|---------|--------------|-----------|------------------------|
| jana-y  | 'stand (up)' | janjana-y | 'keep standing'        |
| kada-y  | 'come'       | kankada-y | 'keep coming'          |
| warri-y | 'run'        | wanarri-y | 'keep running'         |

Some speakers make a distinction between the partially reduplicated form wanarri-y 'perpetual motion, e.g. of running water', and a fully reduplicated form *warri-n-warri-y* 'continuous running by human or animal'.

(ii) Reduplication of second syllable

| bunda-y | 'sit (down)' | bundanda-y | 'keep sitting, live at' |
|---------|--------------|------------|-------------------------|
| wuna-y  | 'lie (down)' | wunana-y   | 'keep lying, sleep'     |

Syllable reduction in partial reduplication has been discussed in §2.5.3.

(b) Reduplication of other than inchoative stems

In reduplication of reciprocal, reflexive/general intransitive and plural subject verb stems it is only the root that is reduplicated. The derivational suffixes -*wa*-, -*ji*- and -*ri*- are then appended to the reduplicated stem. However, in reciprocal and reflexive/general intransitive stems, which are formed from transitive *l*-conjugation roots, the link component is not -*l*-, but - $n$ - according to the conjugation class of the derived stem, i.e. y-conjugation. The same applies for intransitive *l*-conjugation roots (see [§3.8.3.1](#page-1-1)):

| Root           |               | Reduplicated reciprocal stem |                           |
|----------------|---------------|------------------------------|---------------------------|

#### (c) Reduplication of compounds

In compound verbs it is only the second component which is reduplicated, for example:

| Compound        | Reduplicated form       |
|-----------------|-------------------------|
| wumbul-bunga-l  | wumbul-bunga-l-bunga-l  |
| dara-y-mani-l   | dara-y-mani-l-mani-l    |
| ngirray-kanga-l | ngirray-kanga-l-kanga-l |
| buyun-dama-l    | buyun-dama-l-dama-l     |

# 3.B.6 Adverbial forms

A verb may be modified by an adverbial particle or an adverb-like form that is derived from an adjective. None of these forms have inflectional possibilities.

### 3.8. 6.1 Adverbial particles

Kuku Yalanji has a set of particles that may accompany a verb and in some way describe the action referred to by the verb. These particles are listed below, grouped into semantic fields:

| Posture (rest)     |                        |
|--------------------|------------------------|
| jangka             | 'upright, straight'    |
| jarrbarr           | 'prone, on stomach'    |
| mingki             | 'crouching, squatting' |
| Direction (motion) |                        |
| wadu(wadu)         | 'astray, off course'   |
| maku               | 'straight towards'     |
| walku              | 'past'                 |

<sup>19</sup> Since Kuku Yalanji does not allow geminate consonants (see [§2.2.1](#page-1-1)) link - $n$ - and root-initial  $n$  contract to single  $n$ . The link component is therefore not represented in such forms.

| Manner             |                                                      |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| ngambuy            | 'fittingly, appropriately'                           |
| nganjarr(nganjarr) | 'discreetly, with a hidden purpose'                  |
| wudu               | 'absorbed in some activity'                          |
| ngura              | '(too) fast'                                         |
| yarngkay           | 'secretly'                                           |
| nguymal            | 'thoroughly, truly'                                  |
| Others             |                                                      |
| nguyarr            | 'not quite (i.e. an action occurs, but not totally)' |
| murruji            | 'cannot'                                             |
| kanban             | 'by mistake'                                         |
| nganga             | 'briefly'                                            |
| jururr(jururr)     | 'repeatedly; with motion verbs: one after the other' |

These forms may be reduplicated and/or take the manner suffix -ku like adjectives in adverbial function (see §3 .8.6.2). (Where a reduplicated form is given in the above list, this is the normally used form.) Nevertheless these particles are distinct from adjectives in that they (a) can occur in simple root form; (b) do not have to take manner suffix -ku; and, more importantly, (c) cannot be part of a noun phrase and take case inflections like adjectives. Adverbial particles may be placed anywhere in a clause but the preferred position is immediately before or after the verb.

The following sentences illustrate the use of some of these particles:

- ( 1 92) Nyulu kadar kuni-ny nguymal(-ku). 3sg.NOM(A) wallaby.ABS(O) hitlkill-PAST thoroughly 'He killed the wallaby with one shot.' (i.e. he made a thorough job of it)
- ( 1 93) Buliman kada-ny nganjarrnganjarr. police.ABS(S) come-PAST discreetly 'The police came discreetly.' (i.e. plain-clothes police)
- ( 1 94) Kari bunda-y! Ngarri buyun. Yunu-nji nguyarr dara-y. NEG sit-IMP leg.ABS(S) bad 2sg-COMIT not.quite fall-NONPAST 'Don't sit down! [The bench] has a rotten leg. It will tip over with you.' (i.e. not really fall, but just tip to one side)
- ( 1 95) Ngayu juku kulji-bu nguyarr kuni-ny. I sg.NOM(A) tree.ABS(O) stone-INST not.quite hit-PAST 'I did not quite hit the tree with the stone (but the stone may have touched it in passing).'
- ( 1 96) Yundu ngambuy bundanda-y bayan-ba. 2sg.NOM(S) appropriately sit.REDUP-NONPAST house-LOC 'You look just right living in that caravan.' (i.e. you fit in appropriately)

# 3.8. 62 Derived adverbs

Adverbs may be derived from adjectives or comitative or privative stems by the following processes:

- (a) attaching a 'manner' suffix -ku (to be glossed as ADVerb)
- (b) reduplication
- (c) reduplicated form + -ku.

Process (a) is the most productive, (b) is less often and (c) very rarely used. With comitative and privative stems reduplication is not favoured. Some examples are:

| jinbal    | 'quick'       | jinbal-ku          | 'quickly, fast'  |
|-----------|---------------|--------------------|------------------|
|           |               | jinbal-jinbal(-ku) |                  |
| buyun     | 'bad'         | buyun-ku (etc.)    | 'badly'          |
| mumbar    | 'neat, firm'  | mumbar-ku          | 'neatly, firmly' |
| kuli-ji   | 'angry, wild' | kuli-ji-ku         | 'angrily'        |
| kiru-kari | 'stupid'      | kiru-kari-ku       | 'stupidly'       |

- (1 97) Yinya karra mumbar-ku wunana-y. that.ABS(S) rope.ABS(S) neat-ADV lie.REDUP-NONPAST 'The rope is lying coiled up. ' (lit. neatly)
- (198) *Yarraman mukul waymbul-ku dunga-y.* horse.ABS(S) old.ABS(S) slow-ADV go-NONPAST 'The old horse is walking slowly.'

In transitive clauses, the derived adverb is based on an adjective + 'neutral' ergative/ instrumental form, for example:

| (199) | Nyulu                               | ngarrbal        | jinbal-da-ku       | wukurri-ny. |
|-------|-------------------------------------|-----------------|--------------------|-------------|
|       | 3sg.NOM(A)                          | stranger.ABS(O) | quick-ERG/INST-ADV | follow-PAST |
|       | 'He quickly followed the stranger.' |                 |                    |             |

(200) *Diburr mumbar-abu-ku bulin-ba yijarri-ka!* egg/s.ABS(O) careful-ERG/INST-ADV plate-LOC put-IMP 'Put the eggs carefully on the plate!'

It is not clear whether the inflection represents ergative case agreement with the agent, or instrumental. The former is commonly found in Western Desert languages, such as Yankunytjatjara (Goddard, pers. comm.). The interpretation of ergative case agreement is supported by the fact that such inflected forms occur only in transitive sentences. (Note also that some other modifiers such as possessive forms, for instance, take always 'neutral' inflection, regardless of the type of inflection on the head noun.)

A commonly used adverb is based on the suppletive demonstrative root yala 'this' which also functions as a comparison particle 'like, same' (see §3.9.2).

(201) Yala-ku ba lka I like-ADV speak/make-IMP 'Speak like this/make [it] like this !'
