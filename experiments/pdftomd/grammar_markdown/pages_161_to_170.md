### 4.2.2 Causative constructions

There are two optional transitivising processes in Kuku Yalanji with causative effect: state causative and action causative. Both change an underlying S to O.<sup>17</sup>

State causative transitivisers -bunga-l and -kanga-l form transitive compound verbs from a nominal base or adjectival particle. (For compound formation and semantic differences between -bunga-l and kanga-l see §3.8.5.1 (i).) Subject to semantic plausibility it is possible to change an underlying nominal sentence into a transitive sentence of the structure:

<sup>17</sup> In some Australian languages transitivising processes have the effect  $S > O$  or  $S > A$  according to the semantic content of the transitivised verb. (See Dixon 1 980:443.)

## Examples:

- (322) Dingar-angka nyungu kalka dudu-bunga-ny. man-ERG:pt(A) 3sg.POSS.ABS(S) spear.ABS(O) blunt-CAUS-PAST 'The man has made his spear blunt.' (cf. (300»
- (323) Bilngkumu-ngku yinya jalbu manyarr-bunga-ny. crocodile-ERG:pt(A) that.ABS(O) woman.ABS(O) wife-CAUS-PAST 'The crocodile made that woman his wife.' (from a tale about an Annan River crocodile who abducted a woman)
- (324) Dubu-ngku maral yinil-kanga-ny. ghost-ERG:pt(A) girl.ABS(O) afraid-CAUS-PAST 'The ghost frightened the girl.' (cf. (3 1 2»

Apparently it is not possible to transitivise an inflected, e.g. locative, or a derived, e.g. comitative, nominal.

Action-causative transitiviser y-mani-l (see §3.8.5.1 (ii» forms a transitive compound verb from an intransitive verb, thus changing the structure of the underlying intransitive clause

intransitive verb

into

[NP2]A [NP1]O intransitive verb -y-mani-l

meaning: A causes 0 to verb.

Examples:

|-------|-----------------------------|------------|---------------------|

buliman nyunba-y-mani-ny. police.ABS(O) tum. back -CA US-PAST 'That old Aboriginal man made the police tum back.' The form -y-mani-l has also been attested with two transitive verbs in the Yalanji dialect. It does not, however, have an apparent effect on the syntactic structure of the clause, but rather adds a semantic aspect. Consider:

| (328) a. Ngayu                                                          | kaya        | nubi-l-nubi-l.              |

| 'I am looking for [my] dog.'                                            |             |                             |

| 'The man hid the woman.'                                                |             |                             |
| b. Dingar-angka                                                         | yinya       | jalbu ngaki-mani-ny.        |
| man-ERG:pt(A)                                                           | that.ABS(O) | woman.ABS(O) hide-CAUS-PAST |
| 'The man eloped with the woman.' (lit. He caused her to hide with him?) |             |                             |

In both a. and b. examples the A and O NPs remain in their respective functions; the only difference appears to be the added semantic aspect of some kind of 'causation' in the b. sentences.IS

## 4.2.3 Reciprocal

As was shown in §4. 1 .4.3, the core of a transitive sentence in Kuku Yalanji contains a NP in A function and a NP in 0 function. These NPs must not be co-referential in the surface structure. Thus if there is underlying co-referentiality between A and 0 NP as in reflexive (see §4.2.4.2) and reciprocal constructions, the surface form cannot be a transitive sentence.

The concept of reciprocity involves at least two agents which act on each other, as in: 'The dog bites the cat and the cat bites the dog', which can be represented as:

[NP1]A tr V [NP2]O [NP2]A tr V [NP1]O

Here we have two sets of co-referential NPs, NP1 and NP2. In order to give this construction an acceptable surface form NP1 and NP2 are conjoined into NP3 'dog and cat'. NP3 appears in S function and the verb is intransitivised by the reciprocal marker -wa-y (see [§3.8.5.4](#ref-§3.8.5.4) (i)), giving:

tr V-wa-y

The above sentence in the reciprocal Kuku Yalanji form is:

| (330) | Bula                                 | kaya       | buji       | bayka-wa-y.        |
|-------|--------------------------------------|------------|------------|--------------------|
|       | 3du.NOM(S)                           | dog.ABS(S) | cat.ABS(S) | bite-RECIP-NONPAST |
|       | 'Cat and dog are biting each other.' |            |            |                    |

<sup>18</sup> In Dyirbal the transitive verbaliser -ma-l ~ -mba-l may also attach to transitive verbs adding an 'instrumentive' aspect. But unlike the Yalanji examples, this suffix does have a syntactic effect in Dyirbal (see Dixon 1 972:95).

# 1 44 Chapter 4

The underlying form for a reciprocal construction may involve an unspecified number of NPs which are understood to generally act on each other, without each referent necessarily acting on each individual other referent as for instance in:

(331) Jana dingkar kuni-wa-y. 3pLNOM(S) man.ABS(S) hit-RECIP-NONPAST 'The men are fighting (lit. hitting each other).'

Thus NP3 above has to be understood to refer to all members of the set of underlying A and 0 NPs (see Dixon 1 972:2 1 3-2 1 4).

To specify in the surface form that two agents are acting on each other, Kuku Yalanji speakers use a dual pronoun, as in (330) or:

(332) Bula kaya bija-wa-y 3du.NOM(S) dog.ABS(S) lick-RECIP-NONPAST 'The two dogs are licking each other. '

A plural S NP expressed by either a pronoun or a reduplicated noun or noun + -karra (see §3 .2.3.5) implies that an unspecified number of agents is engaged in a general reciprocal action as in (3 31) or:

(333) Jana bayja-wa-y. 3pLNOM(S) ignore-RECIP-NONPAST 'They ignore each other.'

(See also examples in §3.8.5.4 (i).)

## 4.2. 4 Transitive verb + -ji- constructions

#### 4.2.4. 1 Preliminary remarks

All verbs in Kuku Yalanji are strictly transitive or intransitive (see §3.8.3). However, since the verb form itself does not indicate its transitivity value, a judgement on the transitivity of the sentence has to be based on the accompanying A, 0 or S NPs. But even then it is not always obvious whether a sentence is transitive or intransitive, because: (a) pronouns show no formal distinction in transitive or intransitive subject (A or S) function while nouns are not formally distinct in intransitive subject (S) or transitive object (0) function, and (b) A or 0 may be deleted in context-related utterances. Sentences (334a) and (335a) are therefore ambiguous on first sight:

- (334) a. Nyulu bulnga-ny. 3sg.NOM shake-PAST 'He/she shook.' OR 'He/she shook something. '
- (33 5) a. Maral bulnga-ny. girLABS shake-PAST 'The girl shook.' OR 'The girl was being shaken.'

These sentences can be disambiguated by substituting pronoun and noun equivalents in the respective NPs. The correct noun form in (334) and pronoun form in (335) will be:

(334) b. Maral-angka bulnga-ny. girl-ERG:pt(A) shake-PAST 'The girl shook [something].' (33 5) b. Nyunguny bulnga-ny. 3sg.ACC(O) shake-PAST 'He/she was being shaken [by someone].'

This indicates that bulnga-l 'shake' is in fact a transitive verb in Kuku Yalanji. If, on the other hand, *nyulu* and *maral* in (334a) and (335a) could be substituted for each other without change in case marking, bulnga-l would be an intransitive verb, since the only common function of the above noun and pronoun forms is intransitive subject (S).

Under some conditions transitive sentences have to be intransitivised in Kuku Yalanji and again noun/pronoun substitution of core syntactic NPs assists in distinguishing between their function in a truncated transitive clause, like (334a) or (335a), and its intransitivised version.

There are four basic conditions for surface transitive sentences in Kuku Yalanji 19:

- (1) A NP and 0 NP must not be co-referential;
- (2) the described action must be intentional;
- (3) the agent must be stated and should be the most prominent clause constituent;
- (4) the described action must be discrete and performed on a specific object.

If any of these conditions is not met the underlying transitive sentence is intransitivised in surface structure and A and 0 NP assigned to different cases than in a transitive sentence. If transitive sentence condition (1) is not met a reciprocal or reflexive construction is required. If transitive sentence conditions (2) and (3) are not complied with the sentence is passivised. If transitive sentence condition (4) is not met an antipassive20 construction is used.

There are two processes in Kuku Yalanji by which intransitive verb stems can be derived from transitive bases. One is reciprocal derivation with -wa-y (discussed in the previous subsection) and the other is intransitive verb stem formation with -ji-<sup>21</sup> which is used in the three functions of reflexive, passive and antipassive. Reflexes of a reconstructed pA form \*-*DHirri-y* (Dixon 1980:447-449) are commonly used in reflexive, reciprocal and antipassive constructions in Australian languages, i.e. in a basic intransitivising function. (But note that Kuku Yalanji has a separate form for reciprocal which is not found in any of its related languages.) Passive constructions, on the other hand, are unusual in ergative Australian languages. Intransitive sentences with verb + -ji- forms in Kuku Yalanji, the conditions under which they are used and their syntactic and semantic implications, are discussed in tum in the following sections.

#### 4.2.4.2 Reflexive

A transitive construction in which the A NP and O NP are co-referential, which means that an agent performs an action on himself, cannot appear as such in surface form in Kuku Yalanji. The underlying structure

[NPI JA tr V [NPI Jo

has to be intransitivised with the verbal suffix -ji-. Similar to a reciprocal construction, the A and 0 NP together assume S function in surface form, giving:

<sup>19</sup> Similar transitivity conditions have been established for Guugu Yimidhirr (Haviland 1979a:134). Yidiny (Dixon 1 977a:276) and Djabugay (patz 1991 :297-300).

<sup>20</sup> See Silverstein (1976:140).

<sup>21</sup> See also R. Hershberger (1964b:46-49). For stem formation with -ji- see §3.8.5.4 (ii).

[NPtJS tr V-ji-y

meaning: S tr V himself.

Subject to semantic plausibility a reflexive sentence can imply an intentional or unintentional action, but there are ways to clearly distinguish between these two readings. Some reflexivised verbs are inherently intentional by virtue of their semantic content, such as for instance julurri-l 'wash':

(336) Karrkay julurri-ji-y. child.ABS(S) wash-REF-NONP AST 'The child is washing itself. '

With other verbs such as 'scratch', 'hit', or 'cut' it may be ambiguous whether the reflexive action is performed on purpose or by accident. The unmarked reading, out of context, apparently tends to be 'intentional', but to make this perfectly clear one can use a reduplicated verb form indicating ongoing action, which is unlikely to happen by accident.

- (337) Bunjil yaka-n-yaka-ji-ny. widow.ABS(S) cut-*n*-REDUP-REF-PAST 'The widow kept cutting herself.' (It was customary for a woman to inflict a number of skin cuts on herself on the death of her husband.)
- (338) Nyulu *yirrba-n-yirrba-ji-y*. 3sg.NOM(S) scratch-*n*-REDUP-REF-NONPAST 'He keeps scratching himself. ' (perhaps because of mosquito bites)

On the other hand, the use of adverb kanban 'by mistake' unambiguously expresses the accidental nature of an action.

(339) Warru kanban kuni-ji-ny. yg.man.ABS(S) by. mistake hit-REF-PAST 'The young man hit himself by mistake.' (perhaps while hitting at something else)

Usually, contextual information helps to distinguish between an intentional action and a misfortune, as has been suggested in the translations of (338) and (3 39).

| (340) | Bunjil                                                            | yaka-ji-ny        | dunyu-nku.     |
|-------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|----------------|
|       | widow.ABS(S)                                                      | cut-REF-PAST      | husband-DAT:pt |
|       | 'The widow cut herself because of her husband.' (i.e. his death)  |                   |                |
| (341) | Nyulu                                                             | wulbuman          | jina           |
|       | 3sg.NOM(S)                                                        | old.woman.ABS(S)  | foot.ABS(S)    |
|       | mayi                                                              | baka-l-baka-nya.  | baka-ji-ny     |
|       | plant.food.ABS(O)                                                 | dig-l-REDUP-SUB22 | poke-REF-PAST  |
|       | 'The old woman poked her foot while digging for food.' (e.g. yam) |                   |                |

Sentence (341) also illustrates the use of reflexive where a specified body part is affected. Another example is:

<sup>22</sup>For subordinate constructions of this type see §4.4.4. 1.

(342) Ngayu yimbi junka-ji-y. 1 sg.NOM(S) lips.ABS(S) paint -REF-NONP AST 'I paint my lips.' (i.e. put lipstick on)

(For inalienable possessive constructions see §4.S.2).

As I have shown before when discussing the instrumental case (§4. 1 .4.4 (i)), an inanimate agent does not change its case marking, i.e. instrumental, when the sentence is passivised as in (248b) and (249b) and

(343) Nyulu kaja-ji-ny baduru-bu. 3sg.NOM(S) tie-ITR-PAST fishing.line-INsT 'He got tangled up in the fishing line. '23

But consider the similar reflexive construction:

| (344) | Nyulu      | jalbu                                                    | naybu-bu   | yaka-ji-ny,  |
|-------|------------|----------------------------------------------------------|------------|--------------|
|       | 3sg.NOM(S) | woman.ABS(S)                                             | knife-INST | cut-REF-PAST |
|       | minya      | yaka-l-yaka-nya.                                         |            |              |
|       |            | meat-ABS(O) cut-l-REDUP-SUB                              |            |              |
|       |            | 'The woman cut herself with a knife while cutting meat.' |            |              |

Because of the parallelism in structure it would be possible to interpret (248b), (249b) and (343) as reflexive rather than passive constructions. This would also be plausible from a semantic point of view in that where an inanimate instrument is involved in an action on an animate patient, it is in fact the animate patient who can often be held responsible for the action. In (344) the woman as S NP of a reflexive sentence is both agent and patient: she cuts herself by being careless. In the same way, the S NPs in (248b), (249b) and (343) could be seen to indirectly inflict the misfortune of getting hit, burnt or tangled up upon themselves by being inattentive or clumsy. This interpretation would, correctly, deny the inanimate instrument/agent any volitional control over the action. (A similar concept is expressed in colloquial English reflexive-cum-causative construction which would be an appropriate translation for the above sentences, that is 'he got himself burnt by a stinging tree' or 'he got himself tangled up in the fishing line'.) I regard reflexive as a possible alternative interpretation of sentences like (248b), (249b), and (343), but the evidence for this is purely semantic; syntactically they could be agentless passive just as well as reflexive.

# 4.2.4.3 Passive

A passive construction characteristically shifts the focus of attention from the agent, i.e. the transitive subject (A), of a transitive sentence to the patient (0) and hislher state of being acted upon (see Lyons 1 968:372). Whatever mechanisms are employed in different languages to achieve this shift of focus, the resulting 'passive' sentence is a superficially intransitive sentence in which the underlying patient (0) is the intransitive subject (S) and thus usually the discourse topic. The underlying agent, being reduced to an ancillary role, appears in a peripheral syntactic case, if indeed it is mentioned at all. True to the 'patient focus' nature of passives, expression of the agent is not obligatory in any language (see Silverstein 1 976: 140). Nor are there syntactic reasons to include the underlying agent in the surface

<sup>23</sup> For passive formation see next subsection.

# 148 Chapter 4

structure, since the passive as a derived intransitive construction only requires the core elements of intransitive subject (S) and an intransitive verb, all other constituents being optional.

�--------------------.------------------------------------------------------------------�

A passive construction in Kuku Yalanji requires intransitivisation of the transitive verb by stem-forming suffix -*ji*-. The underlying O appears in absolutive case if a noun, and nominative case if a pronoun, and the underlying A receives locative case marking in surface structure. Thus from an underlying sentence

tr Y

we obtain

$$\begin{array}{c} \text{[NP2] } \text{ABS ls]} \\ \text{[NOM]} \end{array} \quad \text{tr} \begin{array}{c} \text{tr} \begin{pmatrix} \text{V} \cdot \dot{j} \text{\\_} \text{[NP1]} \text{LOC} \end{pmatrix} \end{array}$$

which means: 's is being V by NPI ' (NPI being optional). A transitive sentence and its passive version are illustrated below:

- (345) a. Yaburr-ungku warru bayka-ny. shark-ERG:pt(A) yg.man.ABS(O) bite-PAST 'A shark bit the young man.'
	- b. Warru (yaburr-undu) bayka-ji-ny. yg.man.ABS(S) shark-Loc:pt bite-ITR-PAST 'The young man was bitten (by a shark). '

The passive in Kuku Yalanji does not entirely fit the traditional definition of a patienttopicalisation process as given above. It may promote the patient to focus of attention, but it does not necessarily do so. The primary means of topicalisation in any sentence type in Kuku Yalanji is to place the topic in leftmost position. Topic choice and the significance of word order are discussed in §5.3.2.1 and §5.4.1.

One can say that the passive in Kuku Yalanji is semantically motivated or discourseoriented according to which transitive sentence condition is the prompting factor. But it is never necessary to use the passive because of syntactic co-referentiality restrictions in sentence co-ordination, although of course a passive can occur in co-ordinated sentences. According to their prompting condition, there are two types of passive in Kuku Yalanji, which may be termed 'chance passive' and 'topic passive'.

The chance passive is employed where transitive sentence condition (2) (see §4.2.4.1) is not met, that is where a potentially controlling agent performs an action unintentionally. Here the underlying agent is always retained in surface structure, albeit in locative case. In the unmarked word order the agent in locative case appears in leftmost position which means that it does not lose its discourse prominence. Note also that translations of chance passive sentences given by informants did not show passive in English. The involuntary aspect was always rendered as 'happened to'.

The chance passive has only been attested with past tense which is plausible since an accidental action can only be reported in retrospect.

The important characteristic of the chance passive is that the expressed action as such is unpremeditated and unintentional, in other words that 'it just happens'. In (346), for instance, the woman may have been sweeping the yard and in doing so poked a hidden snake with the broom. In (347) the cattle were just wandering about the place at night and chanced on the mangoes under my caravan and proceeded to rout them out. A context for (348) could be that the speaker was walking along minding his own business and happened to see the addressee driving past in a car. This is in contrast to 'accidental' action as expressed in a transitive sentence with adverb kanban 'by mistake'. In this event the action itself is intentional, but it has an unintentional effect. For instance, compare the passive construction in (349) with the transitive sentence using kanban below:

(35 1) Dingkar-angka nganya jina kanban narn-ny. man-ERG:pt(A) I sg.ACC(O) foot.ABS(O) by. mistake step.on-PAST 'The man accidentally stepped on my foot.'

This would imply that the man was intentionally stepping or stamping on something, perhaps ants on the ground, and in doing so accidentally caught my foot. Or a transitive sentence with kanban for (346), that is

(352) lalbu-ngku jarba kanban baka-ny. woman-ERG:pt(A) snake.ABS(O) by. mistake dig/poke-PAsT 'The woman accidentally poked a snake.'

could imply that the woman was digging for scrub-hen eggs and in doing so poked her hand into a snake. Note that speakers do not include kanban in chance passive sentences. While such constructions are not regarded as "wrong", they are thought to be odd.

The 'topic passive' may be used where transitive sentence condition (3) (see §4.2.4. 1) is not fulfilled. This typically occurs where the agent is a lower animate referent acting on a higher animate patient, or where the agent is either unknown or considered irrelevant. In the latter event the agent is omitted from surface structure. Note that topic passive sentences were rendered by a passive construction in English by informants. Examples of passive sentences with a lower animate agent acting on a higher animate patient are:

- (353) Warru wara-nda mani-ji-ny. yg.man.ABS(S) groper-LOC:pt take-ITR-PASf 'The young man was taken by a groper.'
- (354) N gayu yinil-kanga-ji-ny bilngkumu-ndu. I sg.NOM(S) fear-CAUS-ITR-PAST crocodile-Loc:pt 'I was given a fright by the crocodile.'

However, because of its free word order, Kuku Yalanji does not necessarily have to use a passive in order to topicalise the patient. It would be equally acceptable, and is often done, to simply move the 0 NP into sentence-initial position, for example:

1

(355) Warru wara-ngka mani-ny. yg.man.ABS(S) groper-ERG:pt(A) take-PASf 'The young man was taken by a groper.' (cf. (353))

or

(356) Nganya bayka-ny biringal-da. I sg.ACC(O) bite-PASf scorpion-ERG(A) 'I was bitten (stung) by a scorpion. '

On the other hand, passive can be used to topicalise an 0 NP that is at the same hierarchy level as the agent, for example:

(357) Yinya bama buliman-anda that.ABS(S) Aborigine.ABS(S) police-LOC:pt grab-ITR-PAST 'That Aborigine was grabbed by the police.' karrba-ji-ny.

Some speakers tend to prefer passive, others favour the use of transitive sentences with leftmost 0 NP, and apparently there are no speakers' intuitions on a semantic difference between a topic-passive and a topicalised transitive sentence such as (355) or (3 56). There is no choice, however, where the agent is omitted because it is unknown or irrelevant and is not recoverable from context. Here the topic-passive must be used, for example:

(358) Minya dinda-n-dinda-ji-y baya-nga. meat.ABS(S) roast-n-REDUP-ITR-NONPASf fire-LOC 'Meat is roasting in the fire.'

(Note that fire is not the agent; such an interpretation was regarded as quite ridiculous by speakers.)

(359) Store nanda-ji-y nyiku. store.ABS(S) close-ITR-NONPASf today 'The store is closed today.'

The following sentences (360) and (36 1) may also be regarded as agentless passives since the action described by the verb may be interpreted as being performed by an unspecified agent, i.e. 'anyone'.

(360) Nyulu maral ngulkurr nyaji-ji-y. 3sg.NOM(S) girl.ABS(S) good see-ITR-NONPASf 'The girl looks nice.' (lit. is good to look at [by anyone])
