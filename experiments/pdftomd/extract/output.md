Pacific Linguistics is a publisher specialising in grammars and linguistic descriptions, dictionaries and other materials on languages of the Pacific, the Philippines, Indonesia, Southeast and South Asia, and Australia.

Pacific Linguistics, established in 1963 through an initial grant from the Hunter Douglas Fund, is associated with the Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies at The Australian National University. The Editorial Board of Pacific Linguistics is made up of the academic staff of the School's Department of Linguistics. The authors and editors of Pacific Linguistics publications are drawn from a wide range of institutions around the world. Publications are refereed by scholars with relevant expertise who are usually not members of the editorial board.

The 470 publications before Publication 501 were numbered in four series, A, B, C and D, but the series were merged from the beginning of the year 2000 because the rationale for them had gradually disappeared.

### Abbreviations and conventions

Examples consist of three parts:

(a) Kuku Yalanji sentence

The following conventions are used:

- morpheme boundary
- / alternative forms
- ( ) optional material
- { } different morphemes in Yalanji and Nyungkul dialects
- " " direct speech
- clause boundary in co-ordinate and subordinate constructions
- \* ungrammatical sentence or word form
- ? not attested but presumably possible sentence, or construction that is considered awkward although grammatical
- primary and secondary word stress respectively
- I " primary and secondary clause stress respectively

#### (b) Interlinear glosses

These are lined up with the beginning of each Kuku Yalanji word. As far as possible direct translations or semantic approximations have been used for free and bound morphemes alike. Where such translations would have resulted in confusion with other lexical items, abbreviations of the grammatical function have been used. Groups of bound morphemes with similar function but different semantic contents are also indicated by abbreviations referring to the respective function. A list of abbreviations is set out below.

#### (c) Translations

The following conventions are used:

- [ ] items that can be inferred from the Kuku Yalanji sentence
- ( ) editorial comments
- / alternative translations
- " " verbatim translations by speakers or, in context, direct speech

For stylistic reasons English translations contain article the, regardless of whether the Kuku Yalanji example implies definiteness or not. For ease of reading the is not enclosed in parentheses.

# Acknowledgements

I wish to record my deepest gratitude to the Kuku Yalanji people at Wujal Wujal, who accepted me with friendliness and generosity both as a researcher and as a temporary resident in their community. I cannot name all of my helpers here, but I owe special thanks to Charlie Tayley, Bobby Roberts, Louisa Smith, Ruby Friday, Ivy Walker and my babarr Mabel Webb for their unflagging enthusiasm in teaching me their language with intelligence, sensitivity and patience. Long hours of repetitive and tiring work were alleviated by their sense of humour, entertaining anecdotes and activities like forays for bush tucker in which they gladly allowed me to participate. Kuku Yalanji speakers of the Mossman Gorge Mission and the Mareeba settlement, in particular Norman Mitchell, also contributed material.

Hank and Ruth Hershberger of the Summer Institute of Linguistics kindly co-operated with me during fieldwork, comparing notes and making some of their unpublished material a vailable to me.

At The Australian National University I was very fortunate to have the assistance of Professor R.M.W. Dixon, who had introduced me to Australian linguistics, and Dr Harold Koch. They supervised my study with interest and enthusiasm, providing constructive comments and guidance.

During fieldwork I received financial and material assistance in the form of transport and accommodation from The Australian National University and the then Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies.

Mission staff at Mossman, Mareeba and Wujal Wujal, in particular Mr Ed Stephan and Mrs Lydia Stephan, were most hospitable and contributed a great deal to making my visits successful.

For all this help I am most grateful.

## Foreword

Kuku Yalanji, spoken in the area between Mossman and Cooktown in North Queensland, is still a living language. Only about two score of the original 250 distinct Australian Aboriginal languages are still learned by children; Kuku Yalanji is one of them, although its use as the main means of communication in the home has diminished during the past twenty years. This publication is intended to provide a record of the grammar of this language and to make Kuku Yalanji publicly accessible.

This study, based on research undertaken from 1 979 to 1 981, was originally submitted for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in The Australian National University in December 1 982. (Necessary revision according to examiners' recommendations has been undertaken.) Personal reasons prevented earlier publication; but in the meantime the continued dwindling of Aboriginal language resources on the one hand, and some partial success in a painstaking revival of Kuku Yalanji's southern neighbour Djabugay on the other, led to an increased sense of urgency.

Availability of sound language material has played a role in revival efforts of Djabugay. Reduced to only a couple of fluent speakers by the late seventies, Djabugay has been regaining significance for tribal identity and pride since 1 989 through a language course developed by teacher Michael Quinn in cooperation with Djabugay speaker Robert Banning and other members of the Djabugay community. The language course is primarily based on the sketch grammar written as my Honours thesis in 1 978 and the accompanying taperecorded and written material. Publication of the grammar of Djabugay in 1991 in volume 4 of the Handbook of Australian Languages provided a boost to the language program.

Kuku Yalanji was estimated to have about 300 speakers in 1 990 and it was, and still is, supported by Language Other Than English (LOTE) courses in the Bloomfield River State School and Mossman High School. However, even in the 1 980s it was felt in the community that it was more important for children to speak English at home than Kuku. This makes sense from a pragmatic point of view, but concentration on the dominant language at the expense of the vernacular often creates new problems, namely eventual loss of cultural identity. The effects of the shift towards English as main medium of communication are already being felt. At present not many of the about ninety Kuku Yalanji primary school children are fluent in their language when they enter the LOTE program in grade three.

This grammar is intended to give an accurate and comprehensive description of the components of this language and its grammatical rules to readers with some knowledge of linguistics. While there is some discussion of theoretical issues, the grammar is not cast in a particular theoretical framework; nor does it extend into sociolinguistic analysis. It will serve as a database for the theoretical linguist, or as the necessary background for the scholar

Significant characteristics of this language that are of particular interest to the linguist include:

- vowel-harmony rules,
- two sets of case endings governed by animacy,
- passive and anti-passive constructions,
- treatment of topic and anaphoric devices in narrative discourse.

The language Kuku Yalanji comprised several dialects; only two of these are still in use, Yalanji and NyungkuL This study is concerned with both dialects, recording any differences that have been observed.

#### 1.1 The language and its speakers

#### 1. 1. 1 Kuku Yalanji and surrounding languages

The Kuku Yalanji language is spoken in the south-eastern coastal region of the Cape York Peninsula of North Queensland, Australia (see Map 1 ). The language name can be analysed as 'the language with "this'" (kuku 'word, language', yala-nji 'this-COMIT' ; see §3.2.3.3).I

To the north and south along the Pacific coast Kuku Yalanji is bordered by genetically related languages Guugu Yimidhirr and Dyabugay respectively. On the basis of cognates and particularly of grammatical features one can say that Kuku Yalanji is more closely related to Guugu Yimidhirr than to Dyabugay. Reference to these languages will be made throughout this study, as well as to Yidiny, south of Dyabugay. Genetically, Yidiny and Dyabugay are probably equally close relations of Kuku Yalanji, but because of the greater geographical distance there would have been less areal influence and diffusion between Yidiny and Kuku Yalanji.

Languages in the north-west to south-west of Kuku Yalanji are of a quite different linguistic type. These are: Gugu Warra, Gugu Mini and Mbabaram, an initial-dropping language (see Map 1).

The concept of 'own language' as distinct from 'other languages' is an important aspect of tribal identity in Australia, as indeed it is for any nation in the world. Thus Aborigines distinguish their own language from that of another tribal group, even if the differences are only slight, sometimes represented by just a few different lexical items. Accordingly, a tribal name is often derived from the language name in Australia, whereas the reverse is seldom encountered (see Dixon 1 980:3 3-43).

It is not uncommon in Australia that a language name is based on a certain linguistic feature of the language (Dixon 1 980:41-42). Guugu Yirnidhirr, north of Kuku Yalanji, also means 'the language with "this'" (yimi 'this').

Where the self-termed 'languages' of several tribes are mutually understandable, the linguist may recognise these as dialects of one superordinate language. But "there was not usually any name for a group of tribes whose speech was mutually intelligible, nor for the language2 [the superordinate language] that we can - on linguistic criteria - assign to them. It is necessary to choose some label for each language2, and this usually has to be done fairly arbitrarily by the linguist" (Dixon 1 980:43).

Map 1: Kuku Yalanji and its neighbours

Kuku Yalanji has been adopted as the cover term for a language that had about a dozen dialects of which all but two are now extinct or known only to a handful of elderly speakers. The Kuku Yalanji dialect, spoken east of the Great Dividing Range (see Map 2, see § 1 . 1 .3), is one of the two remaining dialects with a viable speech community and its name was originally chosen by Oates and Oates (1 964a) to refer to the eastern dialects of this language group. I extend the reference of this language name to include the western dialects, one of which is also termed Kuku Yalanji by its few remaining speakers. Positive identification and geographical placement of the dialects of Kuku Yalanji is difficult for the following three reasons. Firstly, the name by which speakers refer to their own dialect is not always the same as the term used for it by other communities. Secondly, members of a tribal subgroup may use their territory term as identification (i.e. 'inhabitants of'), which does not necessarily imply a dialect difference. Thirdly, because of the continuous shifting about and intermingling of members of different tribal groups, enforced by European administration over several generations, it may be difficult to ascertain where a particular dialect was originally spoken. Previous research has identified thirteen different dialects for Kuku Yalanji which partly overlap in territory. A full list of these dialects is given in Table 1.1. Data has been collected for those dialects marked (\*) in the second and third columns. Map 2 shows the approximate location of these dialects. Several of the dialect names comprise the term kuku (koko) 'word, language' plus presumably a characteristic of the language indicated by the comitative suffix -ji (see §3.2.3.3). However, only two of these are analysable: Kuku Yalanji (see §1.1.1 ) and Kuku Buyunji 'language with bad' or 'bad language'. Other terms cannot be analysed, but it appears that Jungkurara (Tindale column, corresponding geographically to Kuku Tyunkay in Dixon column) may have a territory name as its basis. The ending -ara could well represent the derivation -warm 'inhabitants of' (see §3.2.3.7, and § 1 .2.1.1 'Tribal groups and names'). Possibly, this name does not actually refer to a different dialect (the data for Kuku Tyunkay is in fact identical to that for Muluridyi), but evidence is too scanty to allow a firm decision on this point.

The correspondence in territory for Kuku Buyunji and Yalanji is an example of different terms employed for the same dialect by different groups. Western self-termed Kuku Yalanji speakers (see Brady, Anderson, Rigsby column) refer to the eastern dialect as Kuku Buyunji,2 whereas eastern speakers definitely call their language Kuku Yalanji and refer to the western dialect around Maytown/Palmer River as Kuku Yalaja (see Anderson 1 979:36).

<sup>2</sup> Haviland (1 979a:29) states that Guugu Yimidhirr speakers use the term Gugu Buyun 'bad language' for an "intermediate dialect with lexical and syntactic affinities to both Guugu Yimidhirr to the North and Gugu Yalanji to the South", that was spoken along the Annan River and was apparently "regarded with disdain by their neighbours".

Table 1.1 : Attested dialects of Kuku Yalanji

H. Hershberger and R. Hershberger ( 1 982) call Kuku Jalunji the "Bloomfield dialect", thus placing it in the territory of Kuku Buyunji or eastern Kuku Yalanji. According to my data, this "dialect", which is spoken by the original seashore inhabitants (jalun-ji 'with sea'), differs from the neighbouring dialects only in that it contains words for maritime fauna and flora that are unknown to speakers living a little further inland. No definite information could be obtained from speakers as to whether Jalunji was actually regarded as "different talk"; but whatever the case may be, Jalunji people were confined to the narrow coastal strip and the term cannot apply to the dialect of the Bloomfield River.

A vailable data, which is only scanty for some dialects, shows that the dialects of Kuku Yalanji are very similar, sharing between over 70% and over 90% of common vocabulary and agreeing closely in morphology·8

The eastern Kuku Yalanji dialect and Kuku Nyungkul, from now on referred to as Yalanji and Nyungkul, are the subject of investigation of this study. (I do not use the name Kuku Buyunji since that is not what the speakers call themselves.) Yalanji and Nyungkul have over

> Tindale also includes a dialect called Wakaman in his map for an area extending a great deal further south than the approximate boundary given by Dixon's informants. According to Sutton ( 1 976a: 1 1 6), Tindale's data corresponds to that of the initial dropping language Agwamin and is clearly not a dialect of Kuku Yalanji. Apparently, the name Wakaman was used by different informants for different languages (see Sutton 1 976a and Dixon field notes).

90% of common vocabulary and show only minor morphological differences. Because of the attested close similarity between the dialects of Kuku Yalanji, the linguistic details described here may be taken to apply to the Kuku Yalanji language. Example sentences, unless otherwise indicated, are given in the Yalanji dialect and special mention is made of morphological differences in Nyungkul.

# 1. 1.3 Territory

Speakers of the Kuku Yalanji language traditionally inhabited an area of over 2000 sq km extending from the Mossman River in the south to the Annan River in the north, bordered by the Pacific Ocean in the east and extending inland to presumably just west of Mount Mulgrave (see Map 2). Three ecological zones may be distinguished in this region: open woodland, dense rainforest and coastal plains.

To the west of the Great Dividing Range there is mostly flat to hilly country with open woodland and grass vegetation. Although there are a number of larger rivers such as the Palmer, Mitchell and Saint George Rivers with their tributaries, these rivers are mostly seasonal and may dry up to only a few waterholes in the dry season. Nevertheless, in precontact times this area would have been able to support a fair number of people with good resources of game, fish and plant food.

The eastern slopes of the Great Dividing Range leading down to the Pacific coast are extremely rugged and covered with dense rainforest containing a multitude of permanent springs, creeks and rivers, which provide a reliable water supply and fish resources. Game and plant food were also abundant in the rainforest region. For the most part the slopes descend steeply right to the ocean front, creating a continuous chain of small bays with narrow sand beaches.

More extensive coastal plains exist on the mouths of the larger rivers, e.g. the Bloomfield River and Daintree River. Here the vegetation consists largely of coastal thicket and mangrove swamps. The coastal waters and estuaries had plentiful and reliable resources of fish and other edible maritime fauna, and coastal vegetation also provided some plant foods. These coastal plains and the adjacent gradually narrowing river valleys were apparently heavily populated in pre-contact times, as may be inferred from Hughes' list ( 1 886) of no less than ten tribal groups in Weary Bay at the mouth of the Bloomfield River.

The Yalanji and Nyungkul groups traditionally inhabited the rainforest terrain (see Map 3) in which the present Wujal Wujal Community is situated.

### 1.1.4 Present speakers

The devastating effect of the Palmer River gold rush late last century very quickly decimated the Kuku Yalanji tribes west of the Great Dividing Range to such an extent that several of them are now extinct. It is difficult to estimate the number of remaining speakers of any western dialect, since they are widely dispersed over an area from Mareeba to Cooktown, Kuranda, Chillagoe, Mossman and the Bloomfield River. Others have been resettled at Yarrabah or Palm Island. Three elderly speakers that I briefly consulted were very proficient in their language (western Kuku Yalanji) but bemoaned the fact that the younger generations are on the whole ignorant of the language of their forebears. There is certainly nothing remotely like a 'speech community' for any of the western dialects.

![](_page_6_Figure_1.jpeg)

Map 3: Nyunkul and Yalanji Territory

Eastern Yalanji and Nyungkul are still spoken by about 300 speakers (Schmidt 1 990). Owing to the ruggedness and inaccessibility of their territory they remained largely unaffected by the violence accompanying early European intrusion and have managed to maintain many aspects of their culture and particularly their language. A number of Yalanji and Nyungkul speakers now live at Mossman, but the majority are concentrated in the Bloomfield River valley. There are slightly more Nyungkul than Yalanji speakers and there is also a very small proportion of Bidiji, Yalaji and Guugu Yimidhirr speakers in this area.

Language consciousness and maintenance on the Bloomfield River was boosted by the introduction, in the late 1 970s, of a vernacular literacy program in Kuku Yalanji. The program was developed by the SIL missionary linguists H. Hershberger and R. Hershberger and taught by them, assisted by Aboriginal teacher aides, at the Bloomfield River State School until their departure in 1 985. Aboriginal assistant teachers have been teaching Kuku Yalanji as a Language Other Than English (LaTE) from preschool to year 7 until recently when the program was reduced to begin in year 3. Not only Aboriginal children - in 2001 about 85% of the student population - but also non-Aboriginal children take part. The teaching material is based on the Hershbergers' program, but the school has been updating and revising the material (see Harms et al. 1 997). The Mossman High School, too, includes Kuku Yalanji in its LaTE program for Grade 8 students. It appears that within the constraints of available funding both schools are contributing a great deal towards the maintenance of Kuku Yalanji and its associated culture. However, with two half-hour lessons per week in the primary school program the impact cannot be very strong.

By 1 981, according to my observations, the main language of communication among Aborigines at Wujal Wujal was KukuYalanji and Kuku Nyungkul. The same seemed to apply, at least among the adult population, when I visited the community briefly in 1 990. However, even 20 years ago several parents expressed their view that it would be advantageous for their children's school education to speak English in the home. They therefore did not want to enforce the speaking of Kuku Yalanji in the family. Apparently this trend has continued; a Bloomfield River State School teacher reported in 1 993 that children understood Kuku well, but many were less competent at speaking it. In 200 1 Norman Tayley, Wujal Wujal Community Council member and assistant teacher, confirmed that the use of Kuku in the home had further decreased, that it was hardly used in the community's kindergarten and that consequently the children did not have a proper grasp of the language.

A form of creole is also in use. Typical creole features that I noticed were: suffix -im on English transitive verb roots, e.g. put-im, chuck-im; suffix -bala on adjectives, e.g. that deadbala 'that dead person',jlash-bala 'distinguished' (a slightly derogatory term); blonga or bla 'to indicate possession', e.g. car blonga/bla Cedric 'Cedric's car'; and lexical items too much and big mob for 'a lot', savvy for 'know'.9 For some older speakers the creole is the only way to communicate with white Australians.

## 1. 1.5 Studies of KukuYalanji

Cursory investigations of several dialects obviously belonging to KukuYalanji have been preserved from the period of European settlement between the 1 870s and about 1 900. Word

<sup>9</sup> For a detailed discussion of Cape York Creole, see Crowley and Rigsby ( 1979).

lists varying in length and quality are available for tribes living around the headwaters of the Hodgkirison, Mitchell and Walsh Rivers, presumably speakers of Wakura (Richards 1 924; Mowbray 1 886; Davidson 1 886). Vocabularies from the inhabitants of Weary Bay and the Bloomfield River valley were collected by Hislop ( 1 899), Hughes (1 8 86) and missionary Hoerlein (unpublished, presumably around 1 900). Hislop, one of the first settlers in the Bloomfield River valley and a sensitive observer of the Aborigines (see Roth 1 901-1905) provided an excellent word list which agrees closely with the present data for Yalanji and Nyungkul. Hoerlein's vocabulary with about 550 entries is also of good quality and concurs with present data from the area.

Schmidt, in his Die Gliederung der Australischen Sprachen ( 1 919), used Hislop and Hughes as sources, calling the language Bulponarra, which is the first of the ten names for Weary Bay tribes recorded by Hughes. (Lanyon-Orgill 1 962 gives a list of fifty words of the Bulponara language, allegedly collected prior to 1 80 1 ; however, like much of Lanyon-Orgill's other work, this is probably a hoax.)

Except for some brief investigation of an inland dialect by Tindale in the 1 930s, no further research of the Kuku Yalanji language was undertaken for almost sixty years. Hale, Dixon, and Laycock and Dixon collected some material on several dialects in the early 1 960s (see Table 1. 1 ).

In the late 1 960s and early 1 970s some material of "Gugu-Bujun and Related Languages" and "Kantyu and Koko-Yalandji" was collected and described by N. Holmer and published in 1 988. Holmer's description and analysis of the data contains errors, inconsistencies and unsupported statements. Only a few examples will be given here; for more detail see Dixon ( 1 992). In his chapter 'Gugu Buyun and related languages' Holmer (1988:38) describes in very broad but basically accurate terms the vowel-harmony rules applying in Kuku Yalanji (see §2.5.1). Later, in his chapter 'Kantyu and Koko-Yalandji' he describes the same vowel-harmony rule but extends it to monomorphemic words and explains "the appearance of -i for expected -a" as being "due to the phonetics of Queensland English" (Holmer 198 8 :65). He includes a retroflex stop and retroflex nasal in the consonant system, neither of which in fact exists in Kuku Yalanji (see §2. 1 . 1 ). His classification of locative suffix allomorph -ba as a "postposition" is unsupported ( 1 988 :39, 66) and his identification of stem-forming suffixes "personal-man" and "feminine -gan" is wrong. In short, Holmer's comments do not contribute to the understanding of Kuku Yalanji.

Detailed investigation of Yalanji and Nyungkul began in 1 961 with H. Hershberger and R. Hershberger of the Summer Institute of Linguistics. Between 1 964 and 1 982 they published sketches of the following aspects of Yalanji/Nyungkul: pronouns, nominal and verbal morphology, structure of noun phrases, clauses and sentences, two clitics, stress patterns (all using the tagmemics approach). Several of these publications had been prepared after only six months of fieldwork and are inevitably sketchy and subject to some misinterpretations. In 1 982, with considerably more familiarity with the language, a twoway dictionary appeared with close to 2000 entries, some example sentences and a very brief non-technical grammatical outline. In 1 985 their translation of the New Testament was published.

W. Oates and L. Oates (1964), also of SIL, published notes on phonology, pronouns and cultural background, as well as a two-way vocabulary with about 1000 entries, apparently after only two months of research. The quality of the vocabulary leaves something to be desired, particularly the representation of verbs, which are often listed not as roots but indiscriminately in different inflectional forms. In 1 992, L. Oates published a Kuku Yalanji

dictionary based on the Oates 1 964 vocabulary, the Hershberger dictionary and "two handwritten word lists by Norman Baird", Aboriginal Assistant Teacher at Bloomfield River State School. The dictionary, arranged by semantic fields, is apparently designed for teaching purposes. It includes instructions on morphology and grammar and sample sentences, many of which are taken from Hershberger's translation of the New Testament.

A detailed discussion of suffix -ji was undertaken by 1. A. Ware in 1981 for a MA thesis at North Texas State University. Based on Oates and early Hershberger data Ware argues that -ji, both as nominal and as verbal suffix, is basically a stative marker. While some functions of verbal suffix -ji support this notion when seen in the context of transitivity hierarchy, the range of functions is much more complex (see §3.8.5.4 (ii) and §4.2.4). But more importantly, verbal -ji and nominal -ji, which is just one allomorph of the comitative suffix (see §3.2.3.3), are not the same suffix. Ware's analysis apparently suffers from the limitations of the data available to her.

The work by Hershberger and Oates prior to 1 982 was used as a starting point for this study and has been amended where indicated.

My own investigation of the Yalanji and Nyungkul dialects is based on about 10 hours of recorded texts (85 texts from one to fifteen minutes in length) and about 19 hours of recorded elicited material; further elicitation was taken as notes but not recorded on tape. (Tapes and written material are deposited with the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies in Canberra.) Further insight into the language was gained from listening to and taking part in casual conversations.

Almost all of my data was gathered from speakers of the Wujal Wujal community where I spent about ten months of fieldwork on four visits during 1 979-8 1, becoming an active participant in community life. A small portion of data was collected from Yalanji and Nyungkul speakers living in Mossman and from a speaker of an inland dialect, presumably Kuku Yalaja, living at Mareeba.

In the Wujal Wujal community I worked mostly with a permanent group of five Yalanji and Nyungkul speakers in the age group between 45 and 65. These speakers proved to be most reliable both in their linguistic competence and ability to express language intuitions, and in their wealth of traditional knowledge.

#### 1.2 The culture of the Kuku Yalanji

It can be assumed that there was reasonable cultural homogeneity in the area specified for the KukuYalanji language (see Anderson 1 980:78). However, post-contact history took a dramatically different course in the western and eastern parts of this territory and first-hand information on cultural background is almost exclusively confined to the eastern speakers of KukuYalanji who represent a still largely intact community.

## 1.2.1 Cultural background

This subsection can be no more than a cursory account of some aspects of Kuku Yalanji culture. Unless otherwise indicated, the details presented here are based on personal information from members of the Yalanji and Nyungkul community. (For more detailed discussions of social and particularly economic patterns see Anderson 1 979 and 1980.)

### 1.2. 1. 1 Tribal groups and names

The language name may be used in unchanged form to refer to a native of a Kuku Yalanji-speaking area. As is characteristic of Australian Aborigines, Kuku Yalanji society is closely associated with the land to which they belong. Thus a distinction is made between six groups or 'mobs' which "were and are identified with particular territorial tracts focused more or less on river drainage areas" (Anderson 1 980:78). Members of different 'mobs' used to congregate for ceremonies or when a particular food was abundant in a certain area. They still do so today for festivities that either are arranged spontaneously or are linked to the European calendar, such as Christmas.

Within each 'mob' there are several descent groups associated with "patrilineally inherited relatively boundary specific 'countries' or bubu" (Anderson 1 980:78). These groups are known by the name of their 'country', e.g. banabila-warra 'inhabitants of Banabila (near the mouth of the Bloomfield River)', or wujalwujal-warra 'inhabitants of Wujal Wujal (the mission site on the Bloomfield River), (see Hughes' 1 886 list of tribal names for Weary Bay). The descent group is obliged to care for and maintain their 'country', which usually contains one or more sites of spiritual or mythological significance. These sites are called yirmbal 'story place'.

An overall distinction which encompasses 'mobs' and descent groups is made according to ecological features of the territory, e.g. majaji 'with rainforest' versus ngalkalji 'with open woodland' for rainforest and woodland dwellers, andjalunji 'with sea' versus bana yiralji 'with fresh water' for seashore and river dwellers.

# 1.2. 1.2 Personal names

All members of the Wujal Wujal community now have English first names and surnames. Most people over about 60 years of age also have Aboriginal names, but they are reticent about disclosing them and people are rarely called openly by their native name. Only some native language nicknames are in general use, e.g. jina-baji 'sore foot' for a person who had his foot injured by a stonefish when a young boy.

# 1.2. 1.3 Social structure and marriage

Each Yalanji and Nyungkul speaker belongs to one of two moieties: walarr or dabu, both also referring to bee species. The main totems of these moieties are birrmba 'white cockatoo' and kumurrbina 'black cockatoo' respectively (see W. Oates & L. Oates 1 964a).

A correct marriage partner belongs to the opposite moiety, and children belong to the same moiety as their father. Owing to an overall decrease in number of the KukuYalanji people and earlier interference by missionaries, as well as a somewhat more liberal point of view among the majority of the younger generation (but by no means all of them), it is not always possible nowadays for a 'right' marriage to be arranged. However, if a marriage turns out not to be a happy one, this is generally blamed on the fact that the partners are not 'right' according to tradition.

Formerly, a man could have as many wives as he could support, bearing in mind that he also had to provide to some extent for his in-laws.

#### 12 Chapter 1

Each family member had an intrinsic right to a particular portion of the available food which ensured that provision was made for those who could not fend for themselves, such as the elderly or sick. This convention of obligatory sharing has been extended to money supplies and is still adhered to in the present community (but unfortunately it is now often subject to abuse, according to my informants.)

The relationship between a man and his mother-in-law was and is subject to total avoidance, that is they may not speak to each other or even be in the same room. Less strict taboos apply to other in-law relationships, where the persons concerned may converse but not, for instance, touch each other. These taboos have created some problems in the running of the community, since for instance the local buLiman 'policemen' will refuse to take, say, a drunken father-in-law into custody, and a mother- or son-in-law will miss out on her or his old age pensioner meal, because they must not be together in the room where the meals are served.

There is evidence that an avoidance language was formerly used among certain in-law relations, although it is not clear to which relationships this applied. The last person to know this avoidance style died many years ago and no records of this speech style exist. <sup>10</sup>

# 1.2. 1.4 Food

KukuYalanji territory on the whole had ample food resources. Particularly the rainforest region and coastal strip provided abundant and reliable food supplies, such as fruit and nuts (e.g. bush cherry, blue quandong, wild apple, figs, zamia nut, Moreton Bay chestnut), roots (e.g. yams and wild ginger), wild honey, smaller mammals (e.g. possums and bandicoot), birds and eggs (e.g. scrub hen, cassowary, Torres Strait pigeon), goannas, pythons (poisonous snakes were not eaten), fresh- and saltwater varieties of turtles, fish, and shellfish, crustaceans and insects (e.g. green ant, witchetty grub) (see Anderson 1 979; Roth 1 90 1- 1 905 and 1 907-1910).

Fish, shellfish, turtles and scrub hen eggs as well as some plant foods are still in relatively good supply and are often obtained to supplement the European diet (see Anderson 1 980). A new 'natural' food resource is mangoes and wild pigs, whereas cassowaries, native mammals and pythons have all but disappeared since the introduction of the poisonous cane toad in the area.

Preparation of some plant foods such as zamia nut and hairy yam required elaborate preparation, including roasting, pounding into flour and subsequent leaching in water for several hours (see Roth 1 90 1- 1 905 and 1 907-1 910). In the case of zamia nut, leaching is required to extract the poisonous substance, whereas hairy yam needs to be soaked in water to remove the unpleasant taste. Such labour-intensive foods are rarely prepared today; they have been replaced by white bread and damper.

Meat and fish used to be roasted in a ground oven between hot stones and various types of leaves (see Roth 1 901-1905 and 1 907- 1 910, see also Text 51 in the appendix) and this is still a popular and tasty way of cooking, particularly for freshwater eels, during 'walkabout' expeditions. Boiling in a bark trough or a large shell was a traditional mode of cooking food in the Bloomfield River region but apparently unknown anywhere else in North Queensland.

<sup>10</sup>In the closely related language Guugu Yimidhirr an avoidance speech style is still used between brothersin-law. A description of this can be found in Haviland (1979a, 1979b). However, it would be mere conjecture to assume that the Kuku Yalanji avoidance style was in any way similar.

Cannibalism was not unknown among the Kuku Y alanji, but was only practised when people were driven by hunger. The victim was not killed for that particular purpose, but was eaten after death by natural causes or in a fight. As Roth (1901 :30) reports:

... there was no special distinguishing term for cannibalism, which had no special ceremony attached to it, was not confined to any particular members of the tribe, and was only resorted to when compelled by hunger. There was, however, one instance recorded here [in the Bloomfield River District] where the natives ate the killed on the battle field, both sides joining in the repast, and subsequently resuming the fight.

On the Palmer River, where the huge influx of European and Chinese miners during the gold rush quickly destroyed woodland, rivers and waterholes and with them the resources of game and fish, the Aborigines were soon forced to find alternative food supplies in the form of the miners' animals and the miners themselves. Stories of cannibalism on the Palmer River abound and my informant Charlie Tayley was able to tell me (from hearsay) that Chinese were regarded as better eating than Europeans and that a slain enemy was further utilised by fashioning his skull into a billycan (see Anderson & Mitchell 1 981).

### 1.2. 1.5 Artefacts

Different types of dillybags and traditional hunting weapons such as fish and turtle spears are still made and used today, but metal has replaced the traditional materials for spear prongs and hooks.

# 1.2. 1.6 Medicine

Minor ailments were and largely still are treated with bush medicine, such as yangka 'green ant Guice)' for fever, colds and stomach upsets, or poultices from stewed bark of kabal 'Leichardt tree' or leaves of jujubala 'ironwood tree' applied to a limb for rheumatic pain. In severe or chronic cases of illness the rrunyuji or murri doctor was called upon. He would extract 'by magic' a 'thing', usually a stingray barb or in later times a marble, from the patient's body. This 'thing' was believed to be the cause of the illness and the patient was expected to get better after its removal. One of my informants claimed that some years ago she had been cured in this way from an abdominal complaint after unsuccessful treatment by European doctors. A murri doctor with such healing powers was said to live in Cooktown in the early 1980s and was still consulted as a last resort if western medicine proved ineffective.

# 1.2. 1.7 Taboos

Taboos applying to in-law relationships have been mentioned in § 1 .2. 1 .3 above. Food, either from certain places or obtained by particular family members, may also be subject to taboo. Any game or fish from the north-eastern part of Weary Bay, for instance, is believed to bring about severe illness and must not be eaten. My informants repeatedly warned me against fishing in this area, illustrating their argument with examples of cancer and paralysis that had befallen both Aborigines and white settlers who had not heeded this taboo.

#### 14 Chapter 1

Food collected by a family member is taboo to certain siblings. For instance, a woman is not supposed to eat meat or fish obtained by her younger brother, and a man should not eat certain plant foods and eggs gathered by his younger sister. This rule is still largely observed, whereas another taboo that forbade certain types of game for children and adolescents does not apply any more. (As one of my informants put it: "The old people just wanted to keep the best food for themselves".)

Mention of the name of a deceased person was proscribed totally in former times for as long as the body was decomposing. (The corpse was wrapped in bark and placed in a tree under which a fire was maintained until "only the bones were left". These were then carried around for a while by family members before being buried.) During the decomposition period the name was replaced by the substitute term ngalba in reference to the deceased as well as living persons with the same name. !! Nowadays, the substitute term plus the name, e.g. ngalba 'Ivy', is generally used, whereas family members refer to the deceased only by a kinship term. A recently deceased person is talked about as little as possible and tape recordings, for instance, of such a person must on no account be listened to.

### 1.2. 1.8 Other customs and beliefs

Initiation practices such as piercing of the nasal septum, front tooth extraction and 'marking' with cicatrices have gradually been discontinued over the last sixty years or so, incidentally much to the relief of those people who just managed to avoid such painful operations in their youth.

Persistent offenders, e.g. thieves or breakers of sexual or other taboos, used to be speared, sometimes even to death, according to the severity of their crime.

A common 'magic' practice was the kanyil 'curse song'. The last (reported) kanyil was performed in the late 1 930s. If a person was wronged by someone else, for instance in cases of adultery, he/she would 'sing' the offender(s), which was believed to ultimately bring about the culprit's death (see W. Oates & L. Oates 1 964a).

A person's death was often thought to be caused by sorcery. It was believed that the dead person's belongings would attract the 'spirit' of the sorcerer. This spirit could only be seen by the rrunyunji who would hold watch until the murderer's spirit appeared. Once the murderer was identified, the dead person's family had the duty to avenge their relation by spearing. (Oates and Oates 1 964a report a different way of detection by pointing a stick.) This type of magic and punitive measure has not been practised for many years.

A source of great fear even today are thunderstorms, which usually begin in early November and increase in frequency and intensity until the beginning of the wet season towards the end of December. Some actions are thought to bring about a thunderstorm, e.g. trespassing on a sacred site. Certain practices were and are believed to drive away the storm, such as burning ironwood leaves or turtle skin.

Some 'messenger' birds are accorded great importance, as for instance wakuka 'kookaburra', who is thought to herald the death of a family member.

<sup>11</sup>Ngalba is not etymologically transparent in Kuku Yalanji, but it is presumably cognate to Guugu Yimidhirr ngalba- 'hide, be hidden'. The use of a particular word that is reserved for the sole purpose of substituting a tabooed name is attested only for central Australia, western Queensland and Cape York Peninsula. For a discussion of this strategy in central Australia, see Nash and Simpson (1981).

One of the spirits still believed in is wuyngkul, the spirit of a sick person close to death, who moves about intent on mischief such as causing accidents or sudden pain. It is visible to specially gifted people and will disappear again on the death or recovery of the sick person. During my stays on the Bloomfield River several older people attributed minor accidents or pains to a wuyngkul that was thought to be abroad.

Creation myths of Yalanji and Nyungkul speakers centre on mythical beings which have become associated with certain geographical features. Some of these are kija 'moon', who created women at kijandaku 'Roaring Meg Falls'; kurriyala 'carpet snake, ' who died and is buried at mangkal 'Cedar Bay'; ngurrku 'mopoke'; and bajabaja 'blue tongue lizard', whose eggs hatched in the Bloomfield River bed, dry at the time, and later turned into two prominent rocks in the river. The origin of all rivers and creeks in the area is thought to be the amniotic fluid of one of two sisters who gave birth on ngalbabulal 'Mount Pieter Botte', about halfway between Bloomfield and Daintree.

A spirit which is associated with one particular Yalanji family clan is wadalwadal, a water spirit with female body and fishtail, living in a spring in the Thompson Creek valley. It will not suffer trespassers on its site, but tolerates members of the family who rightly belong there and who may use the spring water that is believed to have healing powers.

### 1.2.2 Recent history

The earliest mention of Aborigines in Weary Bay was made by the explorers Cook ( 1 770) and King ( 1 819, 1 821) who noticed signs of habitation such as campfires and canoes, but saw no people. The first inland explorer William Hann reached the Bloomfield region in 1 872 and reported several encounters with Aborigines, which were generally friendly.

From 1 873, with the discovery of gold on the Palmer River and later tin in the Annan River region, European migration into KukuYalanji territory increased suddenly and dramatically, but its impact was markedly different on the eastern and western tribal groups.

West of the Great Dividing Range where the Palmer River and Hodgkinson gold fields attracted thousands of European and Chinese miners, the Kuku Yalanji fought a fierce but losing battle for survival. Alluvial gold mining in the rivers deprived them of their supplies of water and fish, and game resources were quickly depleted by the environmental impact of the sudden huge alien population with their horses and cattle. Hostile encounters predictably resulted in the death of large numbers of Aborigines and the few successful attacks by the natives had no significant effect other than leading to punitive measures by the Europeans. The open country afforded little protection for the Aboriginal population, who was soon reduced to a few remnants.

East of the Great Dividing Range the Aborigines stood a much better chance of survival for two reasons: firstly, the main attraction of gold was lacking in this region and the influx of Europeans was only slight compared to the Palmer River area. Secondly, the rugged mountainous country covered with virtually impenetrable rainforest prohibited any significant spread of European population while at the same time providing the Aborigines with reliable water supplies, largely undisturbed food resources and, not least, possibilities for concealment. As Anderson (1 979:34) states:

Because of the relative isolation of the Bloomfield River district and due to its extremely rugged terrain and dense vegetation, encounters between Aboriginal people and white settlers were minimal and of a relatively peaceful nature,

# 16 Chapter 1

# and ( 1 979:36):

Due to the nature of the Bloomfield terrain and the types of European activity there, Aborigines could more or less control the amount of interaction they had with whites.

In the late 1 880s there were about 1 200 Europeans in the area between the Annan and Daintree River, mostly tin miners, but also Red Cedar loggers and settlers involved in agricultural enterprises such as sugar, tobacco and coffee plantations. None of these encroached significantly on Aboriginal territory.

Relations between Aborigines and Europeans in this area gradually developed into some form of mutual assistance. Europeans recognised a source of cheap labour in the Aborigines and the latter in turn were quite partial to the commodities that they received as payment, e.g. tobacco, flour, sugar, and tea, and even came to rely to some extent on European food supply. Reliance on foreign food developed mainly because Aboriginal males working for Europeans often spent time away from their tribal groups which deprived their families of their main providers of game and fish. To compensate for this, women often agreed to sexual relations with nearby white miners or loggers who would provide them with food for their families. This was usually done with the consent of the Aboriginal husbands (see Anderson 1 979:35).

Later on, beche-de-mer and pearl shell fishing off the east coast also used Aboriginal labour, but recruiting practices for these enterprises were often of a dubious nature. Boys and young men were either kidnapped by white fishers or sold off by older men of their tribes (see Anderson 1 979:35; J. Haviland and L. Haviland 1 980: 1 34; Loos 1 980).

In 1 8 86 the Queensland Government gazetted a 'Reserve for Aborigines' of about 640 acres as well as a hunting reserve of about 30,000 acres, against the opposition of local settlers who felt that the land could be more gainfully utilised. (An assumption which incidentally was proven wrong by history, since all larger agricultural enterprises in the area failed owing to poor soil and the difficulty of marketing produce because of transport difficulties from this isolated area.)

In 1 887 the Lutheran church was given control of the reserve in an attempt to settle and 'civilise' the Aborigines through regular employment and schooling, but this attempt failed and the mission was abandoned in 1 902. The mission site had proved unsuitable for agriculture and Aborigines never remained on the mission for long. They preferred to control their own lives, which was possible partly through traditional subsistence patterns and partly through symbiotic relationship with European settlers, who did not require the commitment that was expected by the missionaries. There is even evidence that Aborigines, being aware of their own value as labourers, played off the Europeans against each other (Anderson 1 979:36).

For the following fifty years Yalanji and Nyungkul people suffered relatively little interference (compared to other regions in Queensland) from their 'protector', the Queensland Government. Throughout this time Aborigines always slightly outnumbered the European population and continued their assimilation of tribal and European subsistence patterns, congregating in several major camps usually in the vicinity of European settlements. After World War II they moved, or were moved, into the greater Bloomfield valley where a mission station was reopened in 1 956 under the administration of the Queensland Lutheran Mission Board. By 1 988 the population of Wujal Wujal numbered about 3 30.

Since the 1 950s three factors have had an increasingly detrimental effect on the wellbeing of the community: traditionally antagonistic tribal groups now living together, a great reduction in accessible tribal land and lack of self management. 12 In March 1 987 a young man killed himself while detained in the Wujal Wujal watchhouse. The resulting inquiry as part of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody recounted a disturbing story of an Aboriginal community under threat. Access to traditional lands had been greatly curtailed because of "tourist development, real estate speculation, mining and commercial fishing industries and conservationist interests" (Wyvill 1 990:9). Tensions within the community could no longer be alleviated by spreading out on socially productive hunting, fishing and food gathering trips but were acerbated by poor and cramped living conditions, unemployment, alcohol abuse and a general feeling of boredom and frustration (see Wyvill 1 990).

It is therefore heartening to find that at the turn of the millennium Wujal Wujal, now governed by its Aboriginal Community Council, is a growing and apparently optimistic community. Community Development Employment Projects (Commonwealth Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs) provide employment opportunities; the Women's Centre produces arts and crafts for the tourism trade; the Wujal Wujal Kindergarten has about ten children in the care of Aboriginal teachers. Also, the fact that an illegal alcohol outlet close to the 'dry' community disbanded some years ago can only be beneficial.

### 1.2.3 Summary

Concluding the observations on cultural background and recent history one can say that, while the western KukuYalanji succumbed early to the sudden and massive foreign immigration into their territory, contact in the eastern parts progressed more gradually and relatively non-violently. Initially, this allowed the native inhabitants, Yalanji and NyungkuI, the opportunity to assess and adopt those aspects of European civilisation that appeared desirable and to adjust slowly to a western lifestyle, while at the same time maintaining for a long time much of their cultural integrity based on traditional values, beliefs and subsistence patterns. Developments in more recent years have shown that traditional ways were declining, primarily because of lack of land. It also appeared that white administration of the mission settlement had left the Kuku Yalanji and Kuku Nungkul ill-equipped to cope with the now rapidly changing living conditions. However, most recent developments seem more positive and hopeful with respect to the survival of a viable Aboriginal community on traditional land, albeit very much reduced in area, within the framework of mainstream Australian society and economy.

### 2.1 phoneme inventory

Kuku Yalanji has an inventory of sixteen segmental phonemes, consisting of thirteen consonants and three vowels, which is one of the smallest phoneme inventories found in Australian languages.

# 2. 1. 1 Consonants

Kuku Yalanji consonants are shown in Table 2. 1 represented by IPA symbols as well as the letters used by H. Hershberger and R. Hershberger in their practical orthography for Kuku Yalanji, which will be used throughout this text. The practical orthography devised by the Hershbergers is used in the vernacular program in the Bloomfield River State SchooL There are also a number of SIL publications produced for the community that use this orthography, e.g. booklets on child-care, nutrition etc. In my description of Kuku Yalanji grammar I feel obliged to adopt the symbols that Kuku Yalanji speakers are already familiar with. However, I have made two changes in the spelling of some words. The Hershbergers do not distinguish between final n and ny, representing both sounds as n, because they wanted to avoid confusion with the English spelling and pronunciation of final ny as in many. But since final n and ny are clearly distinct (see minimal pairs further on in this sub-section) I do use both symbols word-finally. I also use final y after vowel i (see §2.S.2).

The practical orthography includes one apparently inconsistent aspect. Stop sounds are usually voiced and bilabial and alveolar stops are appropriately represented by letters b and d respectively. The velar stop, on the other hand, is represented by letter k. H. Hershberger and R. Hershberger chose this letter to make an easy distinction between the velar nasal ng and a sequence of alveolar nasal plus velar stop nk.

Stops and nasals in Kuku Yalanji include two peripheral (or non-coronal) series, bilabial and dorso-velar, one apical series and one laminal series. Bilabial stops and nasals are made simply with the lips. The apical series involves the tip of the tongue touching the alveolar ridge as for English [d] and [n]. Stop /d/ may be realised intervocalically as a tap and some speakers have occasionally even been recorded as using a trill [r] in this position. Two words where a trill instead of stop /d/ has been used with some consistency by certain speakers are:

| <i>karray (kaday)</i> | 'come' |
| --------------------- | ------ |
| <i>barriy (badiy)</i> | 'cry'  |

|           | bilabial       | apico-<br>alveolar | apico-post<br>alveolar      | lamino-<br>palatal | dorso-<br>velar |
| --------- | -------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------- | ------------------ | --------------- |
| Stop      | <i>b</i> [b/p] | <i>d</i> [d/t]     |                             | <i>j</i> [/c]      | <i>k</i> [g/k]  |
| Nasal     | <i>m</i> [m]   | <i>n</i> [n]       |                             | <i>ny</i> [ŋ]      | <i>ng</i> [ŋ]   |
| Lateral   |                | <i>l</i> [l]       |                             |                    |                 |
| Rhotic    |                | <i>rr</i> [r]      | <i>r</i> []1<br>(retroflex) |                    |                 |
| Semivowel |                | <i>w</i> [w]       |                             |                    | <i>y</i> [j]    |

Table 2.1: Kuku Yalanji consonants

In a vocabulary list compiled by missionary Hoerlein around the tum of the century the word 'come' is clearly recorded with a stop: katay. (,Cry' is not included in this list.) On the other hand, note that cognates for 'come' and 'cry' in Dyabugay, the southern neighbour of Kuku Yalanji, both contain a trill: karray, barriy (Patz 1 991), whereas Yidiny, Dyabugay's close genetic relative, has badi- and gada- (Dixon 1 977a), and Guugu Yimidhirr, to the North of Kuku Yalanji, has baadhi- with a lamino-dental stop, and gadaa- (Haviland 1 979a). The trill variant of Idl in Kuku Yalanji has been recorded most consistently among speakers who grew up or still live in Mossman, the traditional boundary area, where speakers of both Kuku Yalanji and Dyabugay had been moved together on a mission station. Thus it may be possible that Dyabugay pronunciation has had some influence on these cognates in Kuku Yalanji. On the other hand, and I regard this as the more likely possibility, Id/ and IITI could be merging in intervocalic position in Kuku Yalanji. Tap [r] (see below) is an allophone of both stop Idl and trill IITI in intervocalic position in present-day Kuku Yalanji. The next stage could be the reinterpretation of intervocalic [r] as trill, a phonetic change which may already have been completed in Dyabugay.

Laminal stop and nasal, Iji and Iny/, are produced by placing the blade of the tongue against the hard palate. The laminal stop is usually realised as an affricate in all environments.

Dorso-velar consonants are realised by the back of the tongue being raised against the soft palate as for English g/k, and ng as in sing.

The following minimally distinct words illustrate the phonemic status of stops and nasals in different places of articulation:

Stops

| bilabial       | bubu | 'land, place'    |
| -------------- | ---- | ---------------- |
| apico-alveolar | dudu | 'blunt'          |
| lamino-palatal | juju | 'bum'            |
| dorso-velar    | kuku | 'word, language' |

See Ladefoged (1 975) Consonant Chart.

Nasals

| bilabial       | <i>bama</i>    | 'Aborigine'    |
| -------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| apico-alveolar | <i>bana</i>    | 'water'        |
|                | <i>jalban</i>  | 'tree top'     |
|                | <i>nandal</i>  | 'close, cover' |
| lamino-palatal | <i>jalbany</i> | 'taboo food'   |
|                | <i>nyandal</i> | 'chop'         |
| dorso-velar    | <i>ngandal</i> | 'mouth'        |

Stops are always unaspirated and there is no phonemic distinction between voiced and
voiceless. There is a general tendency for stops to be voiced intervocalically and in
consonant clusters following /l/-, retroflex /r/- and nasals, while in other positions they may
be voiceless.

Like other languages east of the Gulf of Carpentaria (Dixon 1980:143) Kuku Yalanji has
only one lateral, apico-alveolar /l/, which is pronounced with the tip of the tongue touching
the alveolar ridge. After vowels /a/ and /u/ the lateral is slightly velarised, producing a darker
lateral sound similar to [ɫ] in English `table`, for example:

|     | kalal | [1] | 'vine' |
| --- | ----- | --- | ------ |
| but | milbi | [1] | 'show' |

The two rhotics in Kuku Yalanji are distinguished by place and manner of articulation. For trill Irrl the tip of the tongue vibrates against the alveolar ridge while the retroflex continuant Irl is produced by slightly turning back the tip of the tongue and approaching the roof of the mouth with the underside of the tongue tip. Its pronunciation is similar to the continuant in American 'bird' but without lip rounding. Trill Irrl is usually reduced to a tap [f] in intervocalic position in normal speech (but not in citation forms), whereas it is clearly trilled in other positions, for example:

|     | marra    | [r] or [r] | 'zamia nut'    |
| --- | -------- | ---------- | -------------- |
|     | jirray   | [r] or [r] | 'much, plenty' |
| but | ngurrku  | [r]        | 'owl'          |
|     | ngulkurr | [r]        | 'good'.        |

The following minimal pairs illustrate the phonemic status of both rhotics and the lateral:

| malal   | 'spider'                   |
| ------- | -------------------------- |
| malar   | 'gooseflesh'               |
| maral   | 'girl'                     |
| mararr  | 'sail'                     |
| marral  | 'dry'                      |
| karrarr | 'seaweed'                  |
| karrar  | 'species of bird'          |
| kararr  | 'grass, blanket to lie on' |

The Kuku Yalanji phoneme inventory also contains the two semivowels labial-velar Iwl and palatal Iy/. While semivowel Iwl and vowel lui on the one hand and semivowel Iyl and vowel Iii on the other hand are regarded as articulatory identical pairs, semivowel and vowel

are distinguished by duration. A vowel has continuing articulation, whereas a semivowel is characterised by momentary articulation which is produced by a quick movement towards and/or away from the corresponding vowel-type stricture (Catford 1 97 7:131, 165). Semivowel /w/ before or after vowel /u/ is acoustically distinct from the vowel, due to a higher degree of lip rounding and presumably also a narrowing of the cross-section between the articulators in the velar region. Semivowel /y/ before or after vowel /i/ is distinct from the vowel only by a narrowing of the articulatory cross-section by raising the anterodorsal part of the tongue. (Strictly speaking, semivowel /y/ is not a lamino-palatal sound, since a section of the tongue just behind the blade area is involved in articulation. However, to distinguish Iyl from apical and dorsal consonants, I have included it in the lamino-palatal column in the consonant chart.)

Initial /y/ before vowel /i/ or /a/ may be dropped (that is the vowel may be pronounced without the initial onglide) and younger speakers, up to about 20 years of age, have even been recorded as substituting glottal stop for Iyl in this position. Thus there are three alternative pronunciations for words beginning with /y/ followed by /i/ or /a/, for example:

> yinya, inya, ?inya 'that' yanyu, anyu, ?anyu 'this'

Semivowel /y/ after /i/ word-finally or before another consonant is always deleted (see §2.5.2).

Initial /w/ before /a/ is clearly pronounced (there are no examples of initial /w/ before /i/), whereas initial Iwl before lui may be dropped, giving the two alternatives:

wunba, unba 'English bee',

but no glottal stop has been recorded in this position in place of Iw/.

### 2. 1.2 Vowels

Kuku Yalanji has the common Australian inventory of three vowels: /a/, /u/ and /i/. As is characteristic for Australian vowels, they have 'pure' articulation and are never diphthongised in any way. There is no phonemic distinction of vowel length as in the neighbouring languages Dyabugay and Guugu Yimidhirr. Generally, vowels in Kuku Yalanji could be classified as short, with slightly longer allophones occurring in word-final position.

While some Australian languages with the same vowel system allow each vowel a fairly wide range of phonetic realisation (see Dixon 1 980: 1 30), Kuku Yalanji vowels show only little variation in different environments. Figure 2.1 shows the range of vowel realisation in Kuku Yalanji with \* marking the approximate place of articulation of the major allophone.2

The major allophone of vowel /a/ is more central and slightly higher than cardinal vowel /a/. Before velar consonants, lateral /l/, retroflex rhotic /r/ and semivowel /w/ it is pronounced a little further back, whereas before laminal consonants and semivowel /y/ it is slightly fronted and raised. The major allophone of vowel /i/ is less high and less front than cardinal vowel /i/ and is pronounced with spread lips. Before velar consonants, bilabial nasal /m/,

2 In my description of Kuku Yalanji vowels I follow the traditional vowel classification which is based on a correlation of highest point of the tongue and shaping of the lips as represented in stylised form in the vowel quadrilateral (O'Connor 1 973; Ladefoged 1 975; Catford 1 977).

## 22 Chapter 2

lateral /l/ and retroflex rhotic /r/ it is lowered somewhat and pronounced in a more central position with less lip spreading. The major allophone of vowel /u/ is more fronted and lowered than cardinal vowel /u/ and is pronounced with distinct lip rounding. It tends to be lowered in the same environment where /i/ is lowered, and is more fronted before palatal consonants, but distinct lip rounding applies throughout.

#### 2.2 Phonotactics

The majority of Kuku Yalanji roots are disyllabic. Except for three monosyllabic interjections there are no monosyllabic roots. In a word list of 1 340 roots3 there are 1 055 disyllabic and 200 trisyllabic roots, 81 roots with four syllables, and 4 roots with five syllables. All roots begin with a consonant and end in a consonant or a vowel. Thus the structure of Kuku Yalanji roots can be formalised as follows:

C1 (V C2)<sup>n</sup> V (C3) where $n \ge 1$

### 2.2. 1 Possibility of occurrence

The following vowels and consonants can occur in the different phonotactic positions in Kuku Yalanji root structure:

- V can be any vowel.
- C1 must be a single consonant and can be any stop, nasal or semivowel, i.e. /b, d, j, k, m, n, ny, ng, w, yl (see Figure 2.2). One word with initial rhotic IITI has been recorded, rrunyuji 'wise man with magic powers'. This word could perhaps have been part of a ceremonial speech style for which there is no more evidence today. Phonological patterns that are different from the everyday language are not unheard

<sup>3</sup> This word list is based on two sources: the large majority of entries were elicited by myself and a smaller number of lexical items is taken from the word list by W. Oates and L. Oates ( 1964b) and an unpublished preliminary word list by H. Hershberger and R. Hershberger (early 1 960s). Items from these lists were only included in my data after thorough checking with informants. The dictionary published by the Hershbergers in 1 982 has not been taken into account for this study.

of for such speech styles in Australian languages, although they are uncommon (see Dixon 1 980:60).

• C3 must be a single consonant and can be a non-peripheral nasal, the lateral, either rhotic or the lamino-palatal semi-vowel, i.e. In, ny, 1, rr, r, yl (see Figure 2.2).

![](_page_2_Figure_3.jpeg)

Figure 2.2: Initial and final consonants in Kuku Yalanji

• C2 can be:

(i) any single consonant, or a cluster of two or three consonants.

These clusters may be:

- (ii) a homorganic nasal/stop sequence, i.e. 1mb, nd, nyj, ngk/;
- (iii) apico-alveolar nasal Inl plus: a non-apical stop, or a peripheral nasal, i.e. Inb, nj, nk, nm, nng/;
- (iv) semi-vowel Iyl plus: a non-apical stop, or a bilabial nasal, or a peripheral homorganic nasal/stop sequence, i.e. Iyb, yj, yk, ym, ymb, yngk/;
- (v) lateral /l/ plus: a non-apical stop, or a peripheral nasal, or a homorganic nonapical nasal/stop sequence, i.e. lIb, lj, 1m, lng, 1mb, lnyj, lngk/;
- (vi) trilled rhotic Irrl plus: a peripheral stop, or a peripheral nasal, or a homorganic peripheral nasal/stop sequence, i.e. Irrb, rrk, rrm, rrng, rrmb, rrngk/;
- (vii) retroflex rho tic Irl plus: a peripheral stop, or a non-palatal nasal, or a homorganic non-palatal nasal/stop sequence, i.e. Irb, rk, rm, rn, rng, rmb, rnd, rngk/. Clusters Irnl and Irndl stand out from the general pattern of consonant clusters in Kuku Yalanji (see Table 2.2) and there are only one and two occurrences respectively which are:

| murnil  | 'stir, twist'                           |
| ------- | --------------------------------------- |
| warndiy | 'get up from sitting or lying position' |
| kurndal | 'sink in mud or water'.                 |

| nb  | nj  | nk  | nm  | nng  |      |     |       |     |      |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ---- | ---- | --- | ----- | --- | ---- |
| yb  | yj  | yk  | ym  | ?    | ymb  | ?   | yngk  |     |      |
| lb  | lj  | lk  | lm  | lng  | lmb  | lnj | lngk  |     |      |
| rrb | (?) | rrk | rrm | rrng | rrmb | (?) | rrngk |     |      |
| rb  | (?) | rk  | rm  | rn   | rng  | rmb | rnd   | (?) | rngk |

Table 2.2: Heterorganic consonant clusters in Kuku Yalanji

Cluster IrndJ has been attested once in Dyabugay, (barndil 'child'), but no example of 1m! is known for Dyabugay. Neither cluster exists in Yidiny and Dyirbal, further south (Dixon 1 977:35 and 1 972:272-273 respectively), but they are present among the possibilities for consonant clusters in Guugu Yimidhirr to the north of Kuku Yalanji. However, these clusters do have some idiosyncracies in Guugu Yimidhirr in that Irnl may be pronounced as either a cluster of distinct sounds or as a single retroflex nasal, and Irndl as either a sequence of rhotic plus apical nasal and stop, or as retroflex nasal followed by retroflex stop, apparently in free variation (see Haviland 1 979a:37, 40; Dixon 1 980: 1 64). Apparently there are no cognates in Guugu Yimidhirr for the Kuku Yalanji words containing these clusters (Haviland, unpublished word list February 1 981) which makes borrowing from Guugu Yimidhirr into Kuku Yalanji appear unlikely. A more plausible assumption would be that these clusters are an area feature, albeit weak, in the three languages north of Cairns.

Clusters Iyngl and Iynyjl (marked '?') for which no examples have been attested, could reasonably be expected to exist in Kuku Yalanji according to the general pattern, and their absence here may just be accidental gaps in a relatively small word list of only 1 340 roots. The gaps marked by '(?)', on the other hand, are so symmetrical as to suggest the general rule that a rhotic may not be followed by a palatal consonant in Kuku Yalanji. This would represent a special feature of Kuku Yalanji, since northern and southern neighbouring languages do allow such sequences.

Possibilities for intermorphemic consonant clusters are less restricted than those for intra morphemic clusters. Thus in reduplicated forms, compounds, and some inflected forms we can find clusters across the root boundary that cannot occur within the root, I.e. combinations of C3 and Cl. For instance:

reduplicated forms:

| walbulwalbul | 'butterfly'           |
| ------------ | --------------------- |
| dakaldakal   | 'trochus shell'       |
| nurilnuril   | 'keep looking inside' |

compounds:

| miyil-dandi    | 'sleepless' (lit. eye-hard) |
| -------------- | --------------------------- |
| julbarr-warriy | 'slip' (lit. slippery-run)  |

Compounds are defined as such because they inflect as a whole, have primary stress on the first syllable (see §2.6.1 ), and no other morpheme such as a clitic or particle can be inserted between the two parts. Therefore the above examples can be regarded as one word, grammatical as well as phonological, although I hyphenise analysable compounds for clarity.

Inflected nominal forms showing further clusters are:

| dambalda  | 'boot-INST' |
| --------- | ----------- |
| manyarrda | 'wife-ERG'  |

On the other hand, most inflected forms avoid any kind of consonant cluster across the morpheme boundary by inserting a vowel between a root-final consonant and the inflection, for example:

| bama-ngka   | 'Aborigine-ERG' |
| ----------- | --------------- |
| maral-angka | 'girl-ERG'      |
| bama-nda    | 'Aborigine-LOC' |
| maral-anda  | 'girl-LOC'      |

One restriction on intermorphernic consonant clusters is that Kuku Yalanji does not allow geminate consonants, so that a cluster of two identical consonants is reduced to one consonant. For instance, in the reduplication of y-conjugation verbs consonant /n/ is inserted between the roots (see §3.8.5.5 (ii) (a)). If the root begins with /n/, the resulting cluster /nn/ is reduced to single /n/, for example:

_nuka-n-nuka-ji-y_ 'keep eating (itr)'

## → _nuka-nuka-ji-y_.

Bound morphemes, that is inflections, derivations and clitics, differ in their structure from roots in that they are frequently monosyllabic and may even consist of a single consonant or vowel. Disyllabic bound morphemes conform to the phonotactic occurrence possibilities of roots, whereas monosyllabic bound morphemes show some variation: they may begin with a consonant cluster, e.g. potent ergative -_ngkV_, potent locative -_ndV_, and there is one occurrence of morpheme-initial lateral in clitic -/u/-/a. (The presence of initial vowel in a bound morpheme, something which is not possible for a root, is conditioned by root-final consonant, e.g. potent ergative - $VngkV/C$ -, and should therefore not be regarded as a special feature of bound morphemes that goes against the general phonotactic conventions.)

### 2.2.2 Probability of occurrence

The various phonemes of Kuku Yalanji have different relative probability of occurrence, partly depending on the presence of other phonemes within the same word. Occurrence rates for Kuku Yalanji phonemes are based on a lexicon of 1 340 roots (excluding the phonetically unusual form rrunyuji 'wise man with magic powers').

The relative frequency of the three vowels in Kuku Yalanji is listed in Table 2.3. The percentages in this table show that overall / $a$ / is more frequent than / $u$ /, which in turn is more frequent than / $i$ /. The relatively higher occurrence of / $i$ / over / $u$ / in third and fourth vowel positions can be wholly accounted for by the fact that a number of nominal roots with more than two syllables appear to be fossilised comitative forms ending in - $ji$ , and several verb roots of more than two syllables are reinterpreted roots ending in - $rri$ (see §3.8.3.2 (ii)).

|               | a     | u     | i     |
| ------------- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1 st syllable | 46.6% | 35.2% | 18.2% |
| 2nd syllable  | 54.2% | 27.1% | 18.7% |
| 3rd syllable  | 42.3% | 19.8% | 37.9% |
| 4th syllable  | 61.1% | 18.9% | 20.0% |

Table 2.3: Relative frequency of Kuku Yalanji vowels

Looking at the distribution of vowels in first and second vowel position of a root, we find that vowels follow each other with either higher or lower frequency than could be expected. For instance, 35.2% of roots have vowel / $u$ / in first position and 27.1% have / $u$ / in second position. If there was no association between vowels in first and second position, we would expect $0.352 \times 0.271 = 0.095$ , i.e. 9.5% or 128 roots to have / $u$ / in both first and second vowel position. In fact, there are 200 roots, or 14.9%, with / $u$ / as first and second vowel. Thus the actual-to-expected ratio of / $u$ / following / $u$ / is $0.149 \pm 0.095 = 1.57$ . In other words, /u/ follows /u/ more often than expected, and we can say that vowel /u/ has positive association with following vowel lui. The actual-to-expected ratio for each vowel cooccurrence is listed in Table 2.4. These figures show that each vowel in Kuku Yalanji has highest association with the same vowel and relatively lesser association with any other vowel, as set out in Table 2.5. Note that the markedly highest association is between /u/ and /u/, whereas /i/ has some positive association with /a/, although less than with /i/, but overall the least association with /u/.

Table 2.4: Actual-to-expected ratio of vowel co-occurrence in first and second vowel position

|                   | Second position |      |      |      |
| ----------------- | --------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
|                   | a               | u    | i    |      |
| First<br>position | a               | 1.13 | 0.73 | 0.93 |
|                   | u               | 0.79 | 1.57 | 0.79 |
|                   | i               | 1.04 | 0.59 | 1.47 |

Table 2.5: Relative association between vowels in Kuku Yalanji

|     | greatest<br>association with | medium<br>association with | least<br>association with |
| --- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| a   | a                            | i                          | u                         |
| u   | u                            |                            | a, i                      |
| i   | i                            | a                          | u                         |

This pattern is interesting with regard to the vowel-harmony rule for suffixes (see §2.S. I) which requires that /a/ and /i/ be followed by /a/, and /u/ be followed by /u/. It appears that this vowel-harmony rule reflects to some extent the general tendency of vowel co-occurrence within roots.4

Occurrence rates for initial and final consonants are given in Table 2.6. Final consonants are counted only for non-verbal roots, since all verb roots end in a vowel with the final consonants -y and -_l_ in citation form being conjugation markers. Adjectives and nouns each show a slightly higher rate of consonant-final than of vowel-final roots; that is, there is no structural difference between adjectives and nouns concerning the final root constituent. Of a total of 1066 noun and adjective roots, 53% end in a consonant and 47% in a vowel.

It can be seen that more than half of all roots begin with a stop. The most frequent initial segment is _k_ and the least frequent _n_. Of the 582 roots that end in a consonant more than half show a liquid in final position. Lateral /_l_/ is overall the most favoured consonant in final position. According to place of articulation, the most frequent consonants root-initially are labials, followed by palatals and velars with equal occurrence rates, the least frequent consonants are alveolars. The latter, however, have the highest occurrence rate root-finally (owing to the high frequency of liquids). Overall the least common initial consonants are non-peripheral nasals, with palatal nasal Inyl also being quite rare root-finally.

Table 2.6: Frequency rates of initial and final consonants by place and manner of articulation

4 A similar pattern of weak vowel association with roots can be found in Guugu Yimidhirr (Haviland 1979a:39), which also has a vowel-harmony rule for imperative suffixes on -rr conjugation verbs.

The distribution of single consonants and consonant clusters in C2 position shows the following pattern: Liquids and stops $/j/$ and $/k/$ occur with highest frequency. Bilabial stop $/b/$ is the next most common consonant in medial position, followed in frequency by semivowels, bilabial nasal $/m/$ , apical stop and nasal $/d/$ and $/n/$ , and velar nasal $/\text{ng}/$ in this order. The least frequent single consonant in C2 is laminal nasal $/\text{ny}/$ . Among 574 occurrences of consonant clusters, homorganic nasal/stop sequences are the most common ones with an occurrence rate of 34%. Clusters with the lateral or rhotic Irrl as first component followed by a peripheral stop are also fairly frequent (26%). All other clusters have an occurrence rate of less than 5%, the least common being Inm! and Inngl (twice each), Irnl (once) and Irndl (twice), and Iym! (twice), (ranging between 0. 17 and 0.34%).

On the whole there is no clear association in Kuku Yalanji between a consonant and a following or preceding vowel (unlike in Dyirbal; see Dixon 1 972:28 1 -283). The actual occurrence rates for CV and VC combinations generally follow the pattern of expected occurrence rates with only a very slight tendency toward positive association between consonants and vowels that are close in place of articulation and negative association between consonants and vowels that are more distant in articulation. This tendency is most obvious for velar consonants and semivowels. Initial velar stop and nasal $/k/$ and $/\text{ng}/$ and semivowel $/w/$ are markedly less often followed by front vowel $/i/$ than could be expected, whereas semivowel $/y/$ is markedly less often followed by back round vowel $/u/$ . In these cases the consonant clearly has least association with the vowel that is most distant in articulation. VC sequences $/\text{ing}/$ and $/iy/$ , on the other hand, show a surprising departure from this general pattern. Sequence lingl occurs with 1.1 % frequency, whereas only 0.8% would have been expected, and liyl shows less than expected frequency (0.5% versus expected 1.6%). The latter discrepancy may be accounted for by the fact that $/y/$ after $/i/$ word-finally or before another consonant is lost (see §2.5.2). But there is no apparent clue to the reason for the relatively high occurrence of sequence ling!.

# 2.3 Phonological adaptation of English loan words5

When the Kuku Yalanji people came into contact with European civilisation they used two strategies for naming newly introduced commodities. One way was to extend the meaning of Kuku Yalanji words to describe these novelties, as for instance, kambi 'flying fox' for 'clothes' (the flying fox wraps its wings around itself when at rest), diburr 'eggs' for 'bullets', mayi karraji 'fruit with strings' for 'mangoes' (mangoes hang off the tree on long string-like stalks), orjiri-burr 'through the sky' for 'aeroplane'.

Another way of naming things was to use their English name, appropriately adapted to Kuku Yalanji phonology. This process of phonological adaptation, however, seems to have ceased about one generation ago (see Donaldson 1 980:62), presumably with the increase of Kuku Yalanji I English bilingualism. Nowadays one frequently hears words like 'car', 'aeroplane', 'church', 'store', or 'soft-drink' in the Kuku Yalanji discourse of younger speakers, usually with appropriate inflectional affixes (see §3. 1 2), but without phonological adaptation. This new trend also includes the frequent borrowing of English verbs and adjectives, which apparently was not commonly done in the earlier days, again with

<sup>5</sup> For a detailed discussion of this topic see Dixon, Ramson and Thomas ( 1990), Chapter 5 'Borrowings into Australian languages'.

l

morphological, but not phonological adaptation, such as fix-im-bungal, shift-mal-mal, workmani-jiy, or blue-bala, dirty-bala (see §3.12).

Only older speakers (roughly over 60 years of age), who are less proficient in English, still modify some newer words to some extent (usually not totally), e.g. telelzision, or job job for the community's favourite television program in 1 980 Cop Shop. The vocabulary of such older speakers also contains phonologically well-adapted loan words from the earlier contact period (which usually have English pronunciation among the younger speakers), e.g. bulawu 'flour', banabul 'pineapple', mudaka 'motorcar', juka 'sugar'.

Only about a score of English loans have become an integral part of the Kuku Yalanji lexicon. From these, and from the few adaptations still made by older speakers, we can glean the following nine generalisations on phonological change in English loan words (see Dixon 1 972:326):

(i) Kuku Yalanji stops b and j correspond to English fricatives that are closest in place of articulation, i.e. /b/ corresponds to /v, f/ and /j/ to /s, z, ʃ, ʒ/, for example:

| naybu | 'knife'       |
| ----- | ------------- |
| aybi  | 'Ivy (name)'  |
| buji  | 'pussy (cat)' |
| juka  | 'sugar'       |
| maji  | 'matches'     |

An interesting loan which cannot be placed with any amount of certainty is binjin 'petrol'. I have not been able to ascertain an early use of English benzene for petrol, and it might be possible that this is a loan from German, Benzin 'petrol', introduced by the German missionaries.

- (ii) English voiceless and aspirated stops become unaspirated and usually voiced, e.g. _dubayku_ 'tobacco', _muduka_ 'motorcar'. (Note that k in Kuku Yalanji normally represents voiced [g].) The characteristic acoustic features of changes (i) and (ii) were aptly described by my informant Bobby Roberts, who said: "English people say 'pussycat'. Bama say that word too, but we say it lightly way, we don't say phussi or phussikhath, but buji or bujiga".
- (iii) English It I and lsi before a velar stop become Kuku Yalanji IITI, as in marrkin 'musket (rifle)' and warrkin '(a place name) from 'Watkins' (name of an English settler)'.
- (iv) English consonant clusters consisting of a stop or fricative plus a sonorant are broken up by insertion of a vowel, for example:

| jarruja | 'trousers'       |
| ------- | ---------------- |
| gilaja  | 'glass (mirror)' |
| bulawu  | 'flour'          |
| banabul | 'pineapple'      |

If an initial cluster is broken up in this way, the inserted vowel is stressed according to the word-stress rule (see §2.6. 1 ), e.g. jarruja. (Examples are too few to determine rules for the choice of vowel that is inserted.) An initial fricativelstop consonant cluster, on the other hand, is simplified by dropping the first consonant, e.g. buwun 'spoon' (which is the only example in my data).

- 30 Chapter 2
- (v) English loans with initial vowel are preceded by a semivowel which is Iwl before a back vowel and Iyl before a front or central vowel, for example:

| wulman   | 'old man' |
| -------- | --------- |
| yalibala | 'early'   |

- (vi) An initial consonant which is not permitted in Kuku Yalanji phonotactics, but which is retained in loan words, is lateral /l/, e.g. _landin_ 'Landing' (name for the confluence of Thompson Creek and Bloomfield River where there used to be a landing ramp). No loans with original initial rhotic have been attested.
- (vii) Monosyllabic English roots are made disyllabic by either inserting a semivowel sequence within the root:

| buwun | 'spoon'         |
| ----- | --------------- |
| biyin | '(safety) pin', |

or by adding a final vowel, if the original or adapted root ends in a stop, for example:

| biki (or bikibiki) | 'pig'          |
| ------------------ | -------------- |
| juki               | 'chook, (hen)' |
| baybu              | 'pipe'         |
| naybu              | 'knife'        |

(Again, no generalisation on the choice of final vowel is possible.)

- (viii) Final consonants that are not possible in Kuku Yalanji phonotactics are adapted in the following way:
  - (a) by adding a vowel after an original or adapted stop as in (vii) and also gilaji 'glass', mijiji 'Mrs';
  - (b) by changing a stop to a corresponding nasal, as in marrkin 'musket';
  - (c) by changing a peripheral nasal to a non-peripheral one, as in landin 'Landing';
  - (d) or by simply dropping the final consonant, as injarruja 'trousers', bujika 'pussycat', warrkin 'Watkins'.
- (ix) The examples in my data do not give sufficient evidence for a generalisation on the adaptation of vowels, except to say that Kuku Yalanji vowels on the whole approximate the English vowel, and that English [E] or [re] and diphthong [ail before a consonant tend to become layl in Kuku Yalanji, e.g. mayngku 'mango', dubayka 'tobacco', baybu 'pipe'.

### 2.4 Phonetic rules - assimilation

There are three regressive assimilation rules in Kuku Yalanji. These are:

There are three regressive assim

(i)

$$a, u \rightarrow a^{i}, u^{i} / - \begin{Bmatrix} ny \\ j \end{Bmatrix}$$

(ii) $n \rightarrow n\_j$ / -j (iii) $k \rightarrow k^w$ / -u

These rules apply with varying degrees of consistency among speakers.

According to rule (i), vowels $/a/$ and $/u/$ have a palatal offglide if they precede a palatal nasal or stop, for example:

| nukainy   | 'ate'           |
| --------- | --------------- |
| jalbainy  | 'taboo food'    |
| wunkuiny  | 'next day'      |
| jukumuiny | 'from the tree' |
| waijul    | 'burn, cook'    |
| nguijan   | 'jealous'.      |

Generally, palatalisation is stronger with vowel $/a/$ than with vowel $/u/$ .

Rule (ii) determines that apical nasal $/n/$ is palatalised before palatal stop $/j/$ , for example:

| Yalanjji  | '(language name)' |
| --------- | ----------------- |
| baykanjji | 'lest (it) bite'. |

This rule would seem to negate the phonemic distinction between clusters $/nj/$ and $/nyj/$ in Kuku Yalanji. However, assimilation rule (i) helps to show the difference between the two clusters. A palatalised nasal before $/j/$ does not in turn influence its preceding vowel, whereas a phonemic palatal nasal does; that is, assimilation rule (i) precedes assimilation rule (ii). Consider the following minimal pairs:

| binainyji   | 'fig-like fruit'  |
| ----------- | ----------------- |
| binanj-ji   | 'with a rudder'   |
| jalbanj-ji  | 'with a tree top' |
| jalbainy-ji | 'with taboo food' |

According to assimilation rule (iii), velar stop $/k/$ is labialised before round vowel $/u/$ , as for instance in:

| dakwuy | 'hungry'      |
| ------ | ------------- |
| nyikwu | 'now, today'. |

This rule shows greatest variation between speakers, some of them clearly labialising the velar stop and others not at all.

### 2.5 Morphophonological processes

# 2.5. 1 Vowel harmony

For a number of suffixes in Kuku Yalanji the suffix vowel is selected according to vowelharmony rules relating to the last root- or stem-vowel. The affected suffixes are: all allomorphs of nominal inflections ergative, dative, locative, and perlative (with two notable exceptions to be discussed below), verbal subordination suffix -nyV and 'first of all' clitic -ngVrr. For these suffixes the following vowel harmony rules apply:

$$\begin{array}{rcl} \text{suffix vowel} = & u & / & u(\mathbf{C}) \text{-} \\ & a & / & \left\{ \begin{array}{c} a(\mathbf{C}) \\ i(\mathbf{C}) \end{array} \right\} \end{array}$$

In the case of u/u- and a/a- there is clearly total assimilation to the preceding vowel; however, this does not apply where the last stem vowel is $/i/$ .

Data from Wagaman (Dixon, fieldnotes; see also Dixon 1 980:178- 1 79), an inland dialect of the same language as Kuku Yalanji, may give some indication on how this partial vowel harmony developed. Table 2.7 shows the vowel distribution in ergative, dative and locative inflections in Wagaman.

|          | <i>a-</i>                                                        | <i>u-</i>                                        | <i>i-</i>          |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| Ergative | - $\eta$ <i>ga</i><br>(one occurrence<br>of - $\eta$ <i>gu</i> ) | - $\eta$ <i>gu</i>                               | - $\eta$ <i>gu</i> |
| Dative   | - <i>ga</i> (sometimes - <i>gu</i> )                             | - <i>gu</i>                                      | - <i>gu</i>        |
| Locative | - $\eta$ <i>a</i>                                                | - $\eta$ <i>u</i> (sometimes - $\eta$ <i>a</i> ) | - $\eta$ <i>a</i>  |

Table 2.7: Vowel harmony in Wagaman inflections

It appears that these case inflections in Wagaman have the underlying forms: ERG - $ŋ$ gu, DAT -gu, LOC -lJa, which correspond to case inflections in languages that have no vowel alteration. Then the following vowel-harmony rule applies:

| suffix vowel | $u \rightarrow a/a(C)-$ |
| ------------ | ----------------------- |
| suffix vowel | $a \rightarrow u/u(C)-$ |

but after final stem vowel /i/ - the suffix vowel remains unchanged.

It seems that in Kuku Yalanji the harmony pattern for the underlying _a_-final locative suffix has been generalised to apply to _u_-final suffixes such as ergative and dative as well, and has then also spread to other suffixes. For dative and locative the vowel-harmony rules apply totally and no underlying canonical forms -ku DAT or -nga LOC can be determined. Ergative and perlative, on the other hand, each have one allomorph which is never affected by vowel harmony. This is neutral ergative -_bu/V_ and perlative -_burr/V_ which could be regarded as the canonical forms. (Note the typical vowel luI in the ergative inflection.)

It seems reasonable to assume that Kuku Yalanji vowel harmony has developed from the harmony rules that apply in Wagaman, since the present Kuku Yalanji system is more comprehensive and general than the Wagaman rules. The generalisation of the harmony pattern for locative inflection (as in Wagaman) could be explained in the following way. Locative in Kuku Yalanji has a large variety of functions (see §4. 1 .4.4 (iii)), including some references to goal, which in other languages is expressed by dative. Locative therefore has a higher occurrence rate than dative in Kuku Yalanji. If we look at the relative distribution of locative and ergative in discourse, we find that an agent NP is very often a pronoun, where ergative does not apply. Locative inflection, on the other hand, is the same for nouns and pronouns, so that again locative inflections have a relatively higher occurrence rate than ergative inflections. Thus it would appear that Kuku Yalanji vowel harmony has been generalised following the pattern of the most frequently occurring inflection. Furthermore, the fact that the last root vowel is much more often /a/ than /u/ or /i/ (see [§2.2.2, Table 2.3](#)) could have influenced the vowel-harmony rule in Kuku Yalanji. If the Wagaman system applied at some stage in Kuku Yalanji, inflectional suffixes would have contained vowel lal much more frequently than /u/ or /i/. Again, the most common form could then have been

generalised to apply also after root vowel /i/, which occurs least frequently, whereas root vowel /u/ maintained its influence on the following suffix vowel. This also corresponds to the pattern of vowel association that is found within roots, i.e. that /a/ is followed more often by $/a/$ than by any other vowel and $/i/$ has at least some positive association with $/a/$ , whereas $/u/$ has a strong tendency to be followed by $/u/$ (see §2.2.2, Tables 2.4 and 2.5).

## 2.5.2 Deletion of semivowel /y/

After vowel $/i/$ in word-final position or before another consonant, semivowel $/y/$ is not pronounced. Thus we have the rule:

$$\mathbf{y} \stackrel{\ast}{\to} \mathfrak{g} \quad \prime \stackrel{\ast}{\to} \mathbf{y} \quad \prime \begin{Bmatrix} \mathfrak{g} \\ \mathbf{C} \end{Bmatrix}$$

Because of this deletion rule, roots ending in -iy cannot be distinguished from those ending in -i in citation form, but they are distinct in some inflected forms. The neutral locative inflection, for instance, is -ng $V/V$ - and -mb $V/y$ - (with different allomorphs after other consonants). Consider the following roots in citation form (absolutive) and with locative inflection:

| Absolutive: | kulji     | 'stone'                   |
| ----------- | --------- | ------------------------- |
|             | dili      | 'corkwood pine'           |
|             | duli      | 'burnt grass'             |
| Locative:   | kulji-nga | 'on/to the stone'         |
|             | dili-mba  | 'on/to the corkwood pine' |
|             | duli-mba  | 'on/to the burnt grass'   |

From the inflections we can infer that _dili_ and _duli_ have underlying forms with final $/y/$ , _diliy_, _duliy_, whereas _kulji_ is a genuinely _i_- final root. These examples also illustrate the loss of $/y/$ after $/i/$ before a following consonant. Within a root, $/y/$ cannot be recovered in this environment, but the surprisingly low occurrence rate of $/iy/$ in medial position (see §2.2.2) may indicate that some instances of underlying Iyl have been lost.

In order to indicate which inflectional allomorph is used with a particular nominal root, I represent such roots in citation form with final -_i_ or -_iy_ respectively. (Here I differ from the Hershberger spelling system which does not represent final y after i-.)

Similarly, verbal nonpast inflection -y is not pronounced after roots or stems ending in -i. However, rather than introducing an additional nonpast inflectional allomorph of - $\emptyset$ / i-, I represent all y-conjugation verbs with final -y in nonpast tense and in citation form (-y is also the conjugation marker), for example:

citation forrnlnonpast:

| badiy      | 'cry, weep' | pronounced: | badi      |
| ---------- | ----------- | ----------- | --------- |
| karangajiy | 'sneak up'  |             | karangaji |
| manijiy    | 'get (itr)' |             | maniji    |

analogous to: bunday 'sit' janay 'stand'

# 2.5.3 Syllable reduction

The following three syllable reductions have been observed in normal speech:

(i) Locative inflection -nga after root-final /a/ is reduced to root-final long vowel a:, that IS:

Locative -anga � a:

as for instance bana: 'inlto the water' instead of bananga. The reduction of locative inflection to long vowel a: has not been heard more than perhaps half a dozen times in narratives and has always been corrected to -nga by the informant when playing back the tape. But even if it is used only occasionally and is not accepted as an alternative to the full inflection, this reduced form is very interesting when considering Djabugay. In Djabugay the locative inflection for roots ending in a vowel is lengthening of the final vowel (Patz 1 99 1 :264) and the same applies for Yidiny on even-syllabled stems (Dixon 1 977: 1 28). This supports the previous suggestion (see §2.1.1) that Kuku Yalanji is the more conservative and Dyabugay the more innovative of the two languages.

- (ii) The causative verb-forming derivation -bungal is frequently reduced to -bal, particularly in reduplicated forms, e.g. kima-bungal or kima-bal 'make something soft', dandi-bungal-bungal or dandi-bal-bal 'keep making something hard'. Here, not all speakers correct themselves when they have used the reduced form, maintaining that either form is fine. It appears that the reduced form -bal may be in the process of becoming the accepted norm.
- (iii) In some reduplicated verbs a reduced form is already firmly established as the norm. Usually, verb roots reduplicate as a whole, but six very commonly used verbs show only partial reduplication of either the first or the second syllable and these forms are always used instead of the wholly reduplicated forms which by now are even unacceptable. These verbs are:

Reduplication of first syllable:

| banbadiy                          | \*badi-n-bady    | 'keep crying'        |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------- |
| janjanay                          | \*jana-n-janay   | 'keep standing'      |
| kankaday                          | \*kada-n-kaday   | 'keep coming'        |
| wanarriy                          | ?warri-n-warriy  | 'keep running'       |
| Reduplication of second syllable: |                  |                      |
| bundanday                         | \*bunda-n-bunday | 'keep sitting, stay' |
| wunanay                           | \*wuna-n-wunay   | 'keep lying, sleep'  |

(For a full discussion of form and function of verb reduplication see §3.8.S.S (ii).)

Another partially reduplicated verb form that is used occasionally is nukalkal instead of nuka-I-nuka-l 'keep eating'. Again, only the second syllable is reduplicated in the reduced

form. So there are four examples of first-syllable reduplication and three examples of second-syllable reduplication, and the question arises why it should sometimes be only the first and sometimes only the second syllable that is reduplicated. Second-syllable reduplicated forms share the common aspect that the syllable containing the most frequent vowel _/a/_ is reduplicated and the syllable containing a less frequent vowel is dropped. The same pattern is evident in the reduction of -bungal to -bal, and also in the forms banbadiy and wanarriy with first-syllable reduplication. One could therefore make the tentative suggestion that in a reduction process the syllable with the less frequent vowels /u/ and /ɪ/ is deleted and the syllable containing the most frequent vowel /a/ is maintained.

# 2.6 Stress and intonation

Stress, which is characterised by higher pitch and loudness (see Ladefoged 1 975:222ff.), identifies a word as a unit in Kuku Yalanji. Clausal intonation contours, the highest point of which is the clause stress, show some variation and are the only distinguishing feature for certain types of clauses. H. Hershberger and E.v. Pike (1 970) have done a detailed study of stress and intonation in Kuku Yalanji. Unless stated otherwise, my own findings concur with Hershberger and Pike, but I have generalised some of their rules and addressed some further aspects.

## 2.6. 1 Word stress

Every word in Kuku Yalanji has primary stress on the first syllable, after which there is a distinct drop in pitch for disyllabic words and a more gradual drop for words of more than two syllables (see Hershberger & Pike 1970:791-792). Words with four or more syllables that are roots, reduplicated forms, or compounds, may have secondary stress on the third syllable, that is the first syllable of the second root in reduplicated forms of compounds. A reduplicated trisyllabic root may have secondary stress on the fourth syllable, again the first syllable of the second root. (There are apparently no compounds where the first constituent has more than two syllables.) Thus we can set up the general word stress rule:

$V \rightarrow + \text{stress} / # \text{root} [C (VC\_1VC\_1)] -$

where C₁ may be a single consonant or a cluster. For example: (`primary stress, `secondary stress)

| jálbu           | 'woman'                       |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- |
| bájibay         | 'bone'                        |
| wáwubàja        | 'river'                       |
| yálmburràjaka   | 'whale'                       |
| kángkal-kàngkal | 'own children'                |
| mílka-wùlay     | 'forget' (lit. ear-die)       |
| míyil-dùdu      | 'illiterate' (lit. eye-blunt) |
| búlkiji-bùlkiji | 'pipis'                       |

However, secondary stress is not obligatory and is usually omitted in other than careful citation forms, leaving the word with stress only on the first syllable.

Derived stems (other than compounds or reduplicated forms) and inflected forms with or without clitics, for which no detailed stress patterns are indicated by Hershberger and Pike, receive secondary stress as follows:

(i) Disyllabic inflections or derivational suffixes are treated like roots and may have secondary word stress on the first syllable, for example:

| <i>máral-àngka</i>   | 'girl -ERG:pt'   |
| -------------------- | ---------------- |
| <i>ngánjan-ànda</i>  | 'father -LOC:pt' |
| <i>bímakay-kàrra</i> | 'FZ-KPL'         |

(ii) Monosyllabic inflections, derivational suffixes or clitics are unstressed. But if the resulting word has more than three syllables, the penultimate syllable receives secondary stress, unless it is the last root syllable, in which case it remains unstressed, for example:

| báma-ngka                | 'Aborigine-ERG:pt'             |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| báma-ngka-ku             | 'Aborigine-ERG:pt-EMPH₁'       |
| báma-ngka-kù-lu          | 'Aborigine-ERG:pt-EMPH₁-EMPH₂' |
| búlkiji-ku               | 'pipi-EMPH₁'                   |
| búlkiji-mùn-bu           | 'pipi-mun-LOC'6                |
| búlkiji-mun-bù-ku        | 'pipi-mun-LOC-EMPH₁'           |
| yárraman-ànda-kù-lu      | 'horse-LOC:pt-EMPH₁-EMPH₂'     |
| bímakay-karra-ngka-kù-lu | 'FZ-KPL-ERG:pt-EMPH₁-EMPH₂'    |

However, this secondary stress rule does not apply to the combination of suffix + clitic -baja + ku 'very' attached to an adjective (see §3.2.3 .8). None of the syllables in this sequence are stressed, e.g. yalbay-baja-ku. (See Hershberger and Pike 1 970:802, who regard bajaku as a 'word'; however, the consistent absence of stress contradicts this interpretation. )

But again, secondary stress is not obligatory and is in fact apparent only in slow and careful speech. In normal speech, even in long words of up to eight syllables, only the first syllable is stressed, with pitch subsiding over the following two or three syllables and remaining level over the rest. (Such long words are rare, but stems with inflections and clitics consisting of up to five or six syllables are fairly common in discourse.)

## 2.6.2 Clause stress

Clause stress conforms to the word-stress pattern; that is, it falls on the first syllable of a word. It is characterised by higher pitch and loudness as compared to other clause constituents where regular word stress is less prominent.

Hershberger and Pike ( 1 970:792-802) posit rules for obligatory and optional stress for different types of declarative and interrogative clauses. I suggest that it is possible to generalise these rules, saying that each clause has an unmarked stress pattern which may be

changed, if the speaker wants to assign special emphasis to a particular clause constituent. The unmarked stress patterns are as follows:

- (i) In a simple statement with only two constituents, subject (topic) and predicate (comment), clause stress, indicated by , before the vowel, falls on the predicate (see Hershberger & Pike 1970:794), for example:
  - (1) lawunkarra k'aday. '(Our) friends are coming.'
  - (2) Kirrbaji y'albay. `The dugong is big.'
- (ii) In a simple statement with more than two constituents, clause stress falls on the constituent immediately preceding the predicator (see Hershberger & Pike 1970:793, 3.1), for example:
  - (3) Kayangka b'ajibay nukany. `The dog ate a bone.'
  - (4) Kaya m'inyaka wawu. 'The dog wants meat.'
  - (5) Kayangka ngayku m'inya nukany. 'The dog ate my meat.'
  - (6) Kayangka yunu minya ng'awuya nukany. 'The dog ate your turtle meat.'
  - (7) Kaya j'inbal wanarriy. 'The dog is running fast.'
  - (8) Nyulu y'ilayku kadany. 'He came yesterday.'
  - (9) Maral b'ayanba bundanday. 'The girl is staying in the house.'

Hershberger and Pike (1970:801) state that if the stressed clause component is a noun phrase with two or more constituents, each of these constituents is stressed equally strongly. However, according to my observations, it is only the last word in the phrase which receives most prominent clause stress, as in (5) and (6).

The same unmarked pattern of pre-predicator clause stress applies for negative statements; that is, stress is on the negative particle _kari_, which precedes the predicator:

- (10) _Nyulu jarba k'ari nyajiny._ 'He did not see the snake.'
- (11) _Ngayu mayi diburr k'ari nukany._ 'I did not eat the egg(s).'
- (iii) (a) In a content interrogative clause the interrogative pronoun is stressed (see Hershberger & Pike 1970:195):

- (12) W'anyangka mayi nukany? 'Who ate the food?'
- ( 1 3) Yundu w'anyu nyajiny? 'What did you see?'
- (14) Yundu w'anjabu dungay? 'Where are you going?'

The above sentences show unmarked word order, but an interrogative pronoun may occur anywhere in the clause and still attracts clause stress, for example:

- ( 1 2) a. Mayi w'anyangka nukany?
- (13) a. W'anyu yundu nyajiny?
- (14) a. Yundu dungay w'anjabu?
- (iii) (b) In a polar question the predicator is stressed (see Hershberger & Pike 1 970:796):
  - ( 1 5) Yundu jalbu ny'ajiny? 'Did you see the woman?'
  - (16) Yundu d'akuy? 'Are you hungry?'
  - (17) Nyulu d'ungany? 'Did he go?'

This means that polar questions and statements with only two constituents have basically same stress assignment (see (i) above); however, they differ in the level of pitch, which will be discussed below in §2.6.3 .

Following clause stress rule (ii), a speaker can emphasise a particular clause constituent by moving it to the normally stressed pre-predicator position, for example:

( 1 8) Kayangka minya ng'ayku nukany. 'The dog ate illY meat.' cf. (5)

However, any constituent may be stressed for emphasis anywhere in the clause, overruling the unmarked stress pattern of the particular clause type, for example:

| (19) | J'awunkarra kaday.<br>' (Our) friends are coming.' | cf. (1) |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| (20) | K'irrbaji yalbay.<br>'The dugong is big.'          | cf. (2) |

which could be used in answer to the questions 'who is coming?' and 'what is big?'. Further examples of marked stress patterns are:

- (2 1) Mayi m'ayngku nyulu nukany. 'He ate mangoes.'
- (22) Y'ilayku nyulu kadany. 'He came yesterday. '
- (23) Yilayku nyulu k'adany. 'He came yesterday.'
- (24) Ngayu d'iburr kari nukany. 'I did not eat the � (but something else). '
- (25) Wanyangka mayi j'anbal nukany. 'Who ate the guandongs?'
- (26) Yundu j'albu nyajiny? 'Did you see the woman?'
- (27) Nyulu k'irayku dungany? 'Did he go secretly?'

If a polar question contains an adverb, as in (27), stress is in fact usually placed on the adverb, but it may also occur on the verb (see stress rule (iii) b) according to what the speaker enquires about (see Hershberger & Pike 1 970:796).

In tag constructions, which repeat a constituent in nominal form at the end of a clause, after it occurred in pronominal form in its normal clause position, the added noun, which is set off by a slight pause, receives secondary stress. For instance (a comma ',' indicates pause):

- (28) Nyulu ngayku m'inya nukany, kayangka. 'It ate my meat, the dog did.'
- (29) N gayu ny'ungun nyajiny, yinya jalbu. 'I saw her, that woman.'

The same applies, where the subject is given as an 'afterthought', to clarify the reference of a topic noun (thought at first to have a clear referent), for example:

(30) N gayku m'inya nukany, kayangka. 'Ate my meat - the dog. '

In reprise constructions, on the other hand, which prepose a noun phrase that is then followed by a pronoun in normal clause position (see §5.4. 1 ), the preposed constituent receives primary stress, and the stressed constituent of the actual clause receives secondary stress, indicated by ". There is a slight pause after the preposed noun.

- (3 1) K'ayangka, nyulu ngayku m "inya nukany. 'The dog, it ate my meat. '
- (32) Yinya j'albu, ngayu nyungun ny" ajiny. 'That woman, I saw her. '

If the object-NP is preposed, it is usually the verb, and not the pre-predicator constituent, which receives secondary stress.

#### 2.6.3 Intonation contours

Independent statements have intonation contours that peak at clause stress and fall at the end of the clause (see Hershberger & Pike 1 970:802). Thus (3) and ( 1 2), for example, have the intonation contours

![](_page_9_Figure_3.jpeg)

Similarly, tag and reprise constructions have the intonation contours:

![](_page_9_Figure_5.jpeg)

(36) Kayangka, nyulu ngayku minya nukany. see (31)

When clauses are co-ordinated or subordinated, the intonation pattern is quite different.7 The intonation peak is characterised by higher-than-clause stress pitch, but not loudness. It falls on the final syllable of the clause, followed by a slight pause. The otherwise wordstressed penultimate syllable is usually lengthened, but not stressed. Clause stress in the first clause is normal in pitch and loudness, but weakened in following clauses, for example:

![](_page_9_Figure_9.jpeg)

(37) lana wawubajanga ka·dany, mayi wajuny, nu·kany, wunanany. 'They came to the river, cooked food, ate, and slept.'

In subordinated structures, the final rise in the non-final clause carries over into the following clause, usually without a pause in between:

![](_page_9_Figure_12.jpeg)

(38) Ngayu wawubajanga dungay kuyu maninka. 'I go to the river to get some fish. '

<sup>7</sup> See Hershberger and Pike (1970:803) "sequence contour"; their example is unclear in that the final intonation rise and the English gloss suggest a further co-ordinated clause, in which case the intonation contour of the second clause would not be quite as high initially.

Clauses expressing continuous action by several repetitions of the verb have the following intonation contour. Clause stress falls on the first syllable of the first verb, after which pitch remains at the same level until the end with no final drop, and the very last syllable is distinctly lengthened (see Hershberger & Pike 1970:805), for example:

r---------------------------------------------------

(39) Jana dungany dungany dungany dunga::ny. 'They went on and on and on.'

(40) Nyulu mayi nukany nukany nukany nuka::ny. 'He ate and ate and ate and ate.'

3

Intonation contours for polar questions and imperatives are similar to those of statements with final falling intonation, but they differ in level of pitch and particularly in the distance between highest and lowest pitch. If we assume three levels of pitch, the three clauses below can be distinguished as follows:

(41) _Yundu kaday._

'You are coming.' (statement)

2
1

2 (42) Yundu kaday? 'Are you coming?' (polar question) 1 --

![](_page_0_Figure_7.jpeg)

The difference between pitch levels and, particularly, the difference in the final drop in pitch is clearly distinct for these three types of clauses.

# 3.1 Parts of speech

One can distinguish the following word classes with mutually exclusive membership in Kuku Yalanji:

> Nominals - nouns - adjectives - quantifiers Location and time words Personal pronouns Interrogative pronouns Demonstratives Verbs

Particles

Interjections.

The criteria for this classification are partly grammatical, partly formal, and partly semantic. Grammatical criteria are based on syntactic function, and inflectional and derivational possibilities. A purely formal aspect is open versus closed word class.

## 3. 1. 1 Formal and grammatical criteria

All parts of speech except for verbs, particles and interjections could be considered to be nomina Is in the broadest sense because they all inflect for case. However, the feature of open versus closed word class and differences in inflectional systems and forms invite further subcategorisation.

Demonstratives and pronominal parts of speech are closed word classes with symmetrical paradigms that are ordered according to their semantic content like 'here' and 'there' (demonstratives), person and number (personal pronouns), and 'who', 'what' and 'where' (interrogative pronouns). Particles and interjections also constitute closed word classes to which new members cannot easily be added by speakers of the language.

Nominals, location and time words, and verbs are open word classes; that is, there is room for addition by compounding, derivations and borrowing from other languages.

Members of the nominal, pronominal and demonstrative word classes inflect according to a system of syntactic and local cases. Personal pronouns are set off from the other parts of speech in this group in that they have the same form for transitive and intransitive subject versus a different form for transitive object. The other three classes show a formal distinction between transitive subject on the one hand, and intransitive subject and transitive object on the other hand.

Location and time words occur only in local cases which differ to some extent in form from the local cases of the previously mentioned word classes.

Nominals, and location and time words may form transitive and intransitive verb stems by means of derivations.

Verbs are inflected for tense, aspect and mood; other verbal inflections mark clause subordination which is not indicated by any other means. A verb may be modified by an adverbial particle or an adjective in derived adverbial function.

Particles take no inflections of any kind. According to their function they can broadly be divided into two sub-categories: adjectival particles which may act as predicator, and particles with a modifying, often discourse related, function at clause level.

Interjections stand outside the syntactic framework of a clause or sentence. They are usually uttered just by themselves, or preceding a clause or sentence in a discourse context.

#### 3. 1.2 Semantic content

Generally speaking, nominals refer to objects and properties of objects.

Nouns refer predominantly to corporeal objects, such as human beings (including kinship terms, external and internal body parts and bodily excretions), fauna and flora, geographical and geological items, celestial bodies, weather phenomena, artifacts and other objects of human habitat. Further there are terms for 'imaginable' things, such as ghosts and spirits, several specific terms for different types of noises, and terms for human actions such as language, songs, dances and magic practices. Some bodily and mental states are expressed by nouns (warngku 'sleep', kaka 'pain', kuli 'anger', kuru '(female) love or lust'), while others such as hunger, happiness, desire, etc. are expressed by adjectives, verbs or verbal particles.

Kuku Yalanji nouns include a set of generic terms which can occur on their own or may be used as a kind of classifier in conjunction with another noun (see §4.1.1(c)). These are:

| bama    | 'Aboriginal person'                                                             |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| dingkar | 'male'                                                                          |
| jalbu   | 'female'                                                                        |

| dikal   | 'bird'                                                                          |
| jarba   | 'snake'                                                                         |
| kuyu    | 'fish'                                                                          |
| mayi    | 'edible plants (also meal or food in general)'                                  |
| juku    | 'tree (classifies anything wooden such as twigs,sticks, building timber, etc.)' |
| bubu    | 'country, ground, earth, space'                                                 |
| kulji   | 'stone, rock, rock formation (but not mountain)'                                |
| bana    | 'water, liquid'                                                                 |

| muyar  | 'air, wind'                                                                                            |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| baya   | 'fire (also 'firewood' and classifies anything to do with fire such as smoke,<br>matches, hot ashes)'1 |
| kalka  | 'spear'                                                                                                |
| bayan  | 'camp, house, shelter'                                                                                 |
| junjuy | 'something, anything'                                                                                  |

Adjectives denote properties of any nominal referent, for instance size, dimension, value, age, physical and mental characteristics or states, texture, colour, taste, etc. There are three colour terms: ngumbu 'dark', bingaji 'light' and ngalangala 'red, reddish'.

Bingaji also means 'old man', presumably with reference to white hair: the form looks like a comitative derivation with suffix -ji, but it cannot be determined whether the possible root binga means 'light colour' or specifically 'white hair'. N galangala on the other hand could be a reduplicated noun, cf. mulamula 'bright red' derived from mula 'blood', but apparently there is no analysable root ngala.

Note that a number of emotional and physical states are described by noun-verb compounds, e.g. jiba-badiy 'feel sorry, sad (lit. liver-cry)' or wawulay 'feel exhausted' (wawu-wulay 'breath-die').

Quantifiers include numbers nyubun 'one', djambul 'two' and kulurr 'three' and some general terms for quantities such as 'some', 'many', etc. (see §3.2.5).

Location and time words express points of reference in locational and temporal systems, which will be discussed in detail in §3.3.1 and §3.4 respectively.

Semantic content of personal and interrogative pronouns and demonstratives was briefly mentioned in §3.1 .1 and will be detailed further in §3.5, §3.6 and §3.7 respectively.

Verb roots in Kuku Yalanji generally have concrete meaning, referring to motion and rest, perception, voluntary and involuntary utterances, bodily functions, and actions performed on and affecting or effecting an object. Less tangible actions like mental activities are most often expressed by compound verbs. (For more detail see §3.8.2.l, §3.8.5.l and §3.8.5.2).

Particles cover a wide range of meaning, including manner of action, desire, ability, disapproval, negation, uncertainty, conditionality and possibility. The various functions of adverbial, adjectival and discourse particles are discussed in §3.8.6.1 and §3.9.

Interjections comprise yuwu 'yes' and kari 'no', as well as general encouragement, agreement or disagreement. For a full list see §4.1 0.

## 3.2 Nominal morphology

Nouns, adjectives and quantifiers can be distinguished by their semantic content and also on the grounds of some morphological properties. Comparative and intensity markers jarra 'rather, more' and -baja(ku) 'very' only occur with adjectives and quantifiers, while derivational affixes except possessive, comitative and privative are used only with nouns.

H. Hershberger and R. Hershberger ( 1 982) regard baya as a loan word from English 'fire'. This could be possible according to regular phonological adaptation rules (see §2.3), but has not been otherwise substantiated.

Furthermore, quantifiers are distinct from the other two nominal classes in that they take only case inflections from the 'neutral' set.

# 3.2. 1 Case inflections - system

Nominal morphology in Kuku Yalanji distinguishes formally between eight cases, some of which fulfil more than one semantic function. The system of cases and their functions is as follows (for a more detailed discussion see §4. 1 .4):

#### Core syntactic cases

ABSolutive marks the intransitive subject and transitive object of a clause.

ERGative marks the transitive subject.

## Peripheral syntactiC cases

INSTrumental marks the implement that is used by an agent in performing an action.

DATive indicates the goal of a purposeful action, the cause for an action or emotion, or a complement of comparison.

### Local cases

General Locative marks location 'in', 'on', 'at', etc., the goal of a movement (allative), and goal of three-argument verbs 'show', 'give', etc.

ABLative indicates a general source 'from', which is prior in time or location to the action or state referred to in the clause.

ABESSive indicates a locational source, but one which is not left behind by the actor, i.e. a place from which an action is performed.

PERLative is used only in the Nyungkul dialect and marks a defined space through which someone or something passes. (Yalanji speakers use locative case in this function.)

#### 3.2.2 Case inflections -form

Kuku Yalanji has two sets of inflectional allomorphs for all cases except absolutive, instrumental, abessive and perlative. I have termed these inflectional sets 'neutral' and 'potent'. Allomorphs from these sets may be chosen by a speaker according to whether the referent is perceived to be inherently capable of action ('potent' inflection) or not ('neutral' inflection). This distinction largely coincides with the actual 'animacy' or 'inanimacy' of the referent, but does not necessarily have to. (A full discussion of the semantic properties of neutral and potent case inflections is to be found in §4.1 .4.2.)

Case inflections and their allomorphs are listed in Table 3.1 ; examples of inflected nouns illustrating the different allomorphs are given below. Inflections for which there is no distinction between 'neutral' and 'potent' are listed under 'neutral', since this may be regarded as the unmarked set, whereas 'potent' is the marked set (see §4. 1 .4.2).

'Neutral' case inflections do not receive a special gloss in interlinear morpheme translations of example sentences; 'potent' case inflections are glossed as :pt, as in DAT:pt.

Examples of case inflections and their allomorphs:

# 46 Chapter 3

Absolutive case inflection is always zero; that is, the citation form of a nominal coincides with its form in intransitive subject and transitive object function, for example:

| kaya-ø      | 'dog'          |
| ----------- | -------------- |
| dingkar-ø   | 'man'          |
| jarramali-ø | 'thunderstorm' |

# 3.2.2. 1 Historical notes

We can recognise a number of reflexes of pA case inflections in Kuku Yalanji. Proto Australian inflections for ergative, purposive (dative) and locative, as reconstructed by Dixon (1 980:3 1 l ff.), are:

| ergative:  | _-du ~ _-ŋgu ~ \*-lu |
| ---------- | -------------------- |
| locative:  | _-da ~ _-ŋga ~ \*-la |
| purposive: | \*-gu                |

Reflexes of all but pA \*-_lu_ and \*-_la_ in Kuku Yalanji are:

| neutral ergative | -dV   | <   | \*-du  |
| ---------------- | ----- | --- | ------ |
| neutral locative | -ngV  | <   | \*-nga |
| neutral dative   | -kV   | <   | \*-gu  |
| potent ergative  | -ngkV | <   | \*-ngu |
| potent locative  | -ndV  | <   | \*-da  |
| potent dative    | -nkV  | <   | \*-gu  |

As can be seen in the above list, Kuku Yalanji 'potent' locative and 'potent' dative have nasal _n_ before the pA form. It is interesting to note that in some other languages stems of pronouns and human nouns have an incremental _n_ before some non-core case inflections. Warrgamay and Yidiny, for instance, show incremental _n_ with pronouns (Dixon 1980:329 and 1 977:1 68-170 respectively). In Dyirbal proper nouns and some common nouns with human reference may take a stem-forming suffix -J1a- after which the dative inflection is -_ngu_, whereas it is -_gu_ in other environments (Dixon 1972:43-44). The fact that non-core inflections in these languages have a special form that is used with human referents, that is referents which definitely possess the 'ability to act', may throw some light on the development of 'potent' inflections for locative and dative in Kuku Yalanji. Specifically 'human' inflections in other languages have been generalised in Kuku Yalanji to apply to all 'potent' referents. But the development of the distinction between a 'potent' and a 'neutral' ergative inflection remains unclear.

## 3.2.3 Nominal stem formation

Nominal stems in Kuku Yalanji may be formed from nominal roots by affixation, reduplication or compounding.

Stem-forming affixes include the purely formal catalytic suffix -mun-, a nominalising suffix which derives nouns from verbs, and seven suffixes and two prefixes that add a semantic aspect to the meaning of the root. Derivational affixes may be monosyllabic or disyllabic. Criteria for defining these morphemes as derivational affixes are: (a) they cannot occur independently but have to be attached to a nominal root; (b) root and affix are inseparable, that is no other morpheme such as a clitic may occur between them (but two or three derivational affixes may co-occur); (c) the derived stem may be inflected for case; and (d) the stress pattern defines the derived stem as one word, that is word stress is on the first syllable.

### 3.2.3. 1 Catalytic Suffix -ffiun-

With trisyllabic nominal roots or sterns and English loan words with any number of syllables (see §3.12) a catalytic suffix which has the form -mun- is inserted between the root and a non-zero inflection. Suffix -mun- does not alter the normal stress pattern of a word as outlined in §2.6.1. Some examples are:

| bimakay-mun-ungku  | '(not ego's) father's.sister-mun-ERG:pt' |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| kunjuri-mun-du     | 'shield-mun-INST'                        |
| bulkiji-mun-ku     | 'pipi-mun-DAT'                           |
| mungari-mun-bu     | 'Kauri.pine-mun-LOC'                     |
| kalka-ji-mun-ungku | 'spear-COMIT-mun-ERG:pt'                 |

Not all speakers follow this convention consistently, but conservative-minded speakers emphasised that these were the correct forms and leaving out the catalytic suffix would be "not right". (This catalytic suffix is glossed as -mun- in interlinear morpheme glosses.)

#### 3.2.3.2 JDossessive

Alienable possession is expressed by derivational affixes attached to the possessor noun. These suffixes differ according to whether the derived stem has zero inflection (absolutive case) or non-zero inflection; the former also show formal differences in the Yalanji and Nyungkul dialects.

Inalienable possession, such as body parts, may also be indicated by these derivational suffixes, but normally possessor and inalienably possessed noun are simply juxtaposed in a noun phrase without possessive affixation (see §4.5.2). The Yalanji and Nyungkul forms of possessive suffixes are listed in Table 3.2.

|                       | Yalanji      | Nyungkul     |
| --------------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| + zero inflection     | -mu/V-       | -ngV/V-      |
|                       | -Vmu/C-      | -VngV/C-     |
| + non-zero inflection | -ndVmun-/V-  | -ndVmun-/V-  |
|                       | -VndVmun-/C- | -VndVmun-/C- |

## Table 3.2: Possessive suffixes in Yalanji and Nyungkul

The posseSSIve suffix that is used preceding non-zero inflection could possibly be analysed as

potent locative + catalytic suffix -mun-.2

<sup>2</sup> For catalytic suffix -_mun_- see §3.2.3.1. The stem-forming possessive suffix with non-zero inflection in Guugu Yimidhirr is - :ga + -mu-. -mu- is a catalytic suffix like Kuku Yalanji -mun-, and - :ga is interpreted by Haviland ( 1979a:56) as being related to either abessive or goal. (In Djabugay a catalytic suffix, usually -mu-, is added to the regular possessive stem before a non-zero inflection (patz 1991 :269).

Apart from the formal similarity between locative and possessive (see also §3 .2.4), the two constructions also overlap to some extent in function (see §4.5.5.) . .

Some examples of possessive noun phrases in absolutive case in both dialects are:

| Yalanji           | Nyungkul           |                    |
| ----------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| kambi ngamu-mu    | kambi ngamu-ngu    | 'mother's clothes' |
| mayi kaya-mu      | mayi kaya-nga      | 'the dog's food'   |
| dambal maral-amu  | dambal maral-anga  | 'the girl's shoes' |
| bayan dingkar-amu | bayan dingkar-anga | 'the man's shoes'  |

Non-zero inflections on possessive stems are invariably from the neutral set. Some examples in sentences are:

| (44) | Jalbu-ndumun-du                   | dunyu-ngku        | bikibiki   | kuni-ny.       |
| ---- | --------------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------- | -------------- |
|      | woman-POSS-ERG(A)                 | husband-ERG:pt(A) | pig.ABS(O) | hit/shoot-PAST |
|      | 'The woman's husband shot a pig.' |                   |            |                |

- (45) N gayu dunga-y bayan-ba I sg.NOM(S) go-NONPAS[ house-LOC 'I am going to granny's house.' kami-ndamun-bu. FFIMM-POSS-LOC
- (46) N gamu-ngku maral-andamun-bu kuyu mani-ny. mother-ERG:pt(A) girl-POSS-ERG(A) fish.ABS(O) get-PAS[ 'The girl's mother caught a fish.'
- (47) Nyulu yinil kaya-nka karrkay-andamun-ku. 3sg.NOM(S) afraid dog-DAT:pt child-POSS-DAT 'He/she is afraid of the child's dog.'

Apparently there is no separate affix to express 'possessor of a possessor' in either dialect. Such constructions, which were only obtainable in elicitation and are therefore probably forced or stilted, show the normal possessive suffix on both possessor nouns, for example:

- (48) Dingkar-amu ngamu-mu bayan yalbay. man-POSS.ABS(S) mother-POSS.ABS(S) house.ABS(S) big 'The man's mother's house is big.'
- (49) Nyulu kada-ny maral-andamun-muny yaba-ndamun-muny 3sg.NOM(S) come-PAS[ girl-POSS-ABL eB-POSS-ABL bayan-muny. house-ABL 'He came from the girl's elder brother's house.'

For a full discussion of possessive constructions, see §4.5.

#### 3.2.3.3 Comitative

Like most Australian languages Kuku Yalanji has a derivational suffix which indicates, broadly termed, 'with noun' or 'having noun'. A comitative form in Kuku Yalanji may have either attributive function or indicate 'accompaniment' of a person in motion or rest. (For a detailed discussion see §4.6.1 .)

Like case inflections, the comitative suffix has a neutral and a potent variant. Furthermore, slightly different forms are used, if the derived stem takes zero inflection or non-zero inflection. The forms of comitative suffix are set out in Table 3.3. These allomorphs have been used most consistently in elicitation and are generally regarded as the correct forms. However, in normal speech speakers tend to use -iji and -ji in free variation after a rhotic, and forms with or without final -rr in free variation before any inflectional ending.

|                                               | Neutral         | Potent     |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ---------- |
| + zero inflection                             | -iji/R-         | -nji/V-    |
| + non-zero inflection<br>with initial n or ng | -ji/elsewhere   | -Vnji/C-   |
| + non-zero inflection                         | -ijirr/R-       | -njirr/V-  |
| with initial stop or m                        | -jirr/elsewhere | -Vnjirr/C- |

| Table 3.3: Allomorphs of comitative suffix in Kuku Yalanji |       |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----- |
|                                                            | -da   |
|                                                            | -ga   |
|                                                            | -bada |
|                                                            | -baga |

These forms are obviously cognate to the comitative suffixes in the genetically related languages: Yidiny -ji ,.." -yi, Djabugay -i ,.." -nyji ,.." - :rr, and Guugu Yimidhirr -dhirr. It appears that the Guugu Yimidhirr suffix is the most conservative form (cf. -girri in Warrgamay, further south than Yidiny, -dharri in Wirandharri, a Victorian language (Dixon 1 980:325)), whereas the related languages have generally dropped the final -rr but for a few allomorphs, e.g. - :rr/V- in Djabugay, and the suffixes preceding some non-zero inflections in Kuku Yalanji. But even in this environment Kuku Yalanji seems to be gradually losing the final -rr.

Some examples of comitative stems with zero inflection are:

Neutral suffixes

| jukar-iji       | 'with sand, sandy'     |
