when installing packages you have to keep in mind this is a turbo repo so if you are editing a file in

apps/web/app/page.js

you would have to run

cd apps/web && pnpm add shadui

etc

- don't ever run the servers, i will run it on my own

- it should use the turbo mono repo setup
- everything should be imported through @ui/something, @dictionaries/something
- all ui components should be in /ui
- all dictionaries should be in /dictionaries
