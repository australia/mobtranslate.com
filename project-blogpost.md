# Modernizing the MobTranslate Platform: Preserving Aboriginal Languages in the Digital Age

Aboriginal languages are a vital part of Australia's cultural heritage. With many of these languages at risk of being lost, digital tools play an increasingly crucial role in their preservation and revitalization. Today, we're excited to share the journey of modernizing MobTranslate, an open-source platform dedicated to Aboriginal language translation.

## The Importance of Aboriginal Language Preservation

Australia is home to over 250 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages, many of which have been spoken for tens of thousands of years. These languages are not just communication tools but repositories of cultural knowledge, connecting people to country, tradition, and identity.

Unfortunately, many of these languages are endangered. Of the original 250+ languages, only about 120 are still spoken today, and merely 13 are not considered endangered. This makes digital preservation efforts more important than ever.

## Enter MobTranslate: A Community-Driven Approach

MobTranslate was created with a mission to make Aboriginal language resources more accessible through technology. The platform aims to:

1. Provide easy-to-use translation tools
2. Create a collaborative environment where communities can contribute
3. Make language resources available for learners and educators
4. Support the documentation and revitalization of endangered languages

## Our Modernization Journey

When we revisited the MobTranslate codebase, we recognized an opportunity to enhance the platform with modern web technologies, improving both the developer and user experience. Here's how we transformed the application:

### 1. Adopting a Modern Tech Stack

We migrated the application to:

- **Next.js**: For improved performance and SEO
- **TypeScript**: Adding type safety and better developer tooling
- **Tailwind CSS**: For responsive, maintainable styling
- **Monorepo Structure**: Using Turborepo for better code organization

### 2. Type Safety with TypeScript

Converting the codebase to TypeScript was a crucial part of our modernization effort. This brings:

- Improved code reliability through static type checking
- Better developer experience with enhanced IDE support
- Self-documenting code that makes onboarding new contributors easier
- Fewer runtime errors

### 3. Enhanced Component Architecture

We redesigned the UI component system to be:

- Modular and reusable
- Fully typed with TypeScript
- Accessible according to WCAG standards
- Responsive across all device sizes
- Culturally appropriate with design elements inspired by Aboriginal art and colors

### 4. Performance Improvements

The application now benefits from:

- Server-side rendering capabilities
- Code splitting for faster page loads
- Optimized asset delivery
- Modern image handling

### 5. Community Focus

Throughout this modernization process, we kept the community at the heart of our decisions:

- Ensuring the platform remains easy to contribute to
- Improving documentation for new developers
- Creating a culturally sensitive design system
- Maintaining focus on the core mission of language preservation

### 6. Interactive Dictionary Pages

A major enhancement to the platform is the addition of comprehensive dictionary functionality:

- **Language-specific dictionaries** that showcase words, translations, and usage examples
- **Interactive search features** that allow users to filter words in real-time
- **Cultural context** provided alongside linguistic information
- **Responsive design** ensuring dictionaries are accessible on all devices
- **Scalable architecture** allowing for easy addition of new languages

Currently, we support multiple Aboriginal languages including:

- **Kuku Yalanji**: A language traditionally spoken in the rainforest regions of Far North Queensland
- **Mi'gmaq**: A language of the Mi'gmaq First Nations people, indigenous to the northeastern region of North America
- **Anindilyakwa**: A language spoken by the Anindilyakwa people of Groote Eylandt in the Northern Territory of Australia

Each dictionary includes:
- Word entries with English translations
- Grammatical information (parts of speech)
- Example sentences showing usage
- Cultural notes where relevant

### 7. Centralized Dictionary Data Management

One of our most significant technical improvements is the implementation of a centralized dictionary data management system:

- **Unified Data Interface**: All components access dictionary data through a single, consistent API
- **Type-Safe Implementation**: Strong TypeScript typing prevents errors and inconsistencies
- **Flexible Architecture**: Designed to easily transition from mock data to real API endpoints
- **Maintainable Structure**: Single source of truth for dictionary data across the application

This architecture enables:
- Easy addition of new languages without code modifications
- Consistent data structures and behaviors across all dictionary components
- Simplified testing with mock data
- Future integration with external data sources or content management systems

The dictionary system is now completely dynamic, allowing us to scale to any number of languages while maintaining consistent user experience and performance.

This dictionary feature represents a significant step toward making Aboriginal language resources more accessible and interactive. As the platform grows, we plan to add more languages and expand the existing dictionaries with additional words, audio pronunciations, and deeper cultural context.

## Looking Forward

The modernization of MobTranslate represents more than just a technical upgradeâ€”it's about creating a sustainable platform that can serve Aboriginal communities for years to come. With these improvements, we hope to:

- Attract more developers to contribute to the project
- Make the platform more accessible to language communities
- Expand the translation capabilities to cover more languages
- Create integrations with educational resources
